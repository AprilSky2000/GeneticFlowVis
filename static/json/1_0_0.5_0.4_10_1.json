The technique, which we call Virtual Smoke, simulates the use of colored smoke for experimental gaseous fluid flow visualization. However, it is noninvasive and can animate, in particular, the dynamic behaviors of steady-state or instantaneous flow fields obtained from numerical simulations. Virtual Smoke is based on Volume Seeds and Volume Seedlings, which are direct volume visualization methods previously developed for highly interactive scalar volume data exploration. We use data from combustion simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of Virtual Smoke.",

This method allows a computational fluid dynamics user to visualize the basic physical process of dispersion and mixing rather than just the vector and scalar values computed by the simulation. It is based on transforming the vector field from a traditionally Eulerian reference frame into a Lagrangian reference frame. Fluid elements are traced through the vector field for the mean path as well as the statistical dispersion of the fluid elements about the mean position by using added scalar information about the root mean square value of the vector field and its Lagrangian time scale. In this way, clouds of fluid elements are traced not just mean paths. We have used this method to visualize the simulation of an industrial incinerator to help identify mechanisms for poor mixing. >",

In this paper, we present a novel visualization framework that combines the advantages of clustering methods and illustrative rendering techniques to generate a concise and informative depiction of complex flow structures. Given a 3D vector field, we first generate a number of streamlines covering the important regions based on an entropy measurement. Then we decompose the streamlines into different groups based on a categorization of vector information, wherein the streamline pattern in each group is ensured to be coherent or nearly coherent. For each group, we select a set of representative streamlines and render them in an illustrative fashion to enhance depth cues and succinctly show local flow characteristics. The results demonstrate that our approach can generate a visualization that is relatively free of visual clutter while facilitating perception of salient information of complex vector fields.",

            "abstract": "Publisher Summary This chapter describes the design of a parallel volume rendering (PVR) library which renders in-place distributed data on a rectilinear grid. There are special considerations for such design and implementation. It focuses on the PVR algorithm, and provides a thorough discussion on the library design of a parallel polygonrenderer. The chapter performs tests for runtime visualization of a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver, on the Intel Paragon XP/S using from 8 to 216 processors. Interactive visual responses reflecting simulation states and the physical phenomena modeled, allow better control of the simulation, and can offer additional insights into the physics behind the model. Performance studies show that the parallel rendering process is scalable with the size of the simulation as well as with the parallel computer. The chapter mentions that although the current implementation only handles data on a rectilinear grid, the design principles of the library can be generalized to handle unstructured or curvilinear grids as well.",

This complete rendering pipeline makes possible highly efficient rendering and remote viewing of high resolution time-varying data sets in the absence of high-speed network and parallel I/O support.

To maximize the utilization of the vast amount of data generated by these simulations, scientists also need scalable solutions for studying their data to different extents and at different abstraction levels. As we move into peta- and exa-scale computing, simply dumping as much raw simulation data as the storage capacity allows for post-processing analysis and visualization is no longer a viable approach. A common practice is to use a separate parallel computer to prepare data for subsequent analysis and visualization. A naive realization of this strategy not only limits the amount of data that can be saved, but also turns I/O into a performance bottleneck when using a large parallel system. We conjecture that the most plausible solution for the peta- and exa-scale data problem is to reduce or transform the data in-situ as it is being generated, so the amount of data that must be transferred over the network is kept to a minimum. In this paper, we discuss different approaches to in-situ processing and visualization as well as the results of our preliminary study using large-scale simulation codes on massively parallel supercomputers.",

However, as we are entering the era of peta- and exa-scale computing, this sub-sampling approach is no longer acceptable because too much valuable information is lost. In situ visualization has been shown a promising approach to the data problem at extreme-scale. We present a novel in situ solution using depth maps to enable post-hoc image-based visualization and feature extraction and tracking. An interactive interface is provided to allow for fine-tuning the generation of depth maps during the course of a simulation run to better capture the features of interest.

The goal of studying the cost of parallel rendering on a new class of supercomputers such as the Blue Gene/P is not necessarily to achieve real-time rendering rates. It is to identify and understand the extent of bottlenecks and interactions between various components that affect the design of future visualization solutions on these machines, solutions that may offer alternatives to hardware-accelerated volume rendering, for example, when large volumes, large image sizes, and very high quality results are dictated by peta- and exascale data. As a step in that direction, this study presents data from experiments under a number of conditions, including dataset size, number of processors, low- and high-quality rendering, offline storage of results, and streaming of images for remote display. Performance is divided into three main sections of the algorithm: disk I/O, rendering, and compositing. The dynamic balance among these tasks varies with the number of processors and other conditions. Lessons learned from the work include understanding the balance between parallel I/O, computation, and communication within the context of visualization on supercomputers; recommendations for tuning and optimization; and opportunities for further scaling. Extrapolating these results to very large data and image sizes suggests that a distributed-memory high-performance computing architecture such as the Blue Gene is a viable platform for some types of visualization at very large scales.",

Through tabular organization and a clear correspondence between parameters and results, the interface eases the discovery, comparison and analysis of the underlying data.

A good visualization comes from experimenting with visualization, rendering, and viewing parameters to bring out the most relevant information in the data. A good data visualization system thus lets scientists interactively explore the parameter space intuitively. The more efficient the system, the fewer the number of iterations needed for parameter selection. Over the past 10 years, significant efforts have gone into advancing visualization technology (such as real-time volume rendering and immersive environments), but little into coherently representing the process and results (images and insights) of visualization. This information about the data exploration should be shared and reused. In particular, for types of data visualization with a high cost of producing images and less than obvious relationship between the rendering parameters and the image produced, a visual representation of the exploration process can make the process more efficient and effective. This visual representation of data exploration process and results can be incorporated into and become a part of the user interface of a data exploration system. That is, we need to go beyond the traditional graphical user interface (GUI) design by coupling it with a mechanism that helps users keep track of their visualization experience, use it to generate new visualizations, and share it with others.

This paper presents a new approach to the problem of extracting and visualizing 4D features within large volume data. Conventional methods requires either an analytical description of the feature of interest or tedious manual intervention throughout the feature extraction and tracking process. We show that it is possible for a visualization system to learn to extract and track features in complex 4D flow field according to their visual properties, location, shape, and size. The basic approach is to employ machine learning in the process of visualization. Such an intelligent system approach is powerful because it allows us to extract and track an feature of interest in a high-dimensional space without explicitly specifying the relations between those dimensions, resulting in a greatly simplified and intuitive visualization interface.",

Converting AMR data onto a uniform mesh would result in high storage requirements, and rendering the uniform-mesh data on an average graphics workstation can be painfully slow if not impossible. The adaptive nature of the embedded mesh demands sophisticated visualization calculations. In this work, we compare the performance and storage requirements of a parallel volume renderer for regular-mesh data with a new parallel renderer based on adaptive sampling.

This paper describes our study of a coherent solution based on quantization coupled with octree and difference encoding, and adaptive rendering for efficient visualization of timevarying volumetric data. Quantization is used to attain voxel-level compression and may have a significant influence on the performance of the subsequent encoding and visualization steps. Octree encoding is used for spatial domain compression, and difference encoding for temporal domain compression. In essence, neighboring voxels may be fused into macro voxels if they have similar values, and subtrees at consecutive time steps may be merged if they are identical. The software rendering process is tailored according to the tree structures and the volume visualization process. With the tree representation, selective rendering may be performed very efficiently. Additionally, the I/O costs are reduced. With these combined savings, a higher level of user interactivity is achieved. We have studied a variety of time-varying volume data sets, performed encoding based on data statistics, and optimized the rendering calculations wherever possible. Preliminary tests on workstations have shown in many cases tremendous reduction by as high as 90% in both storage space and inter-frame delay when compared to direct rendering of the raw data.",

Direct volume rendering is used to depict the space-time relationships of seismic readings collected from sensor stations in an intuitive way such that the progress of seismic wave propagation of an earthquake event can be directly observed. The resulting visualization reveals the sequence of seismic wave initiation, propagation, attenuation over time, and energy releasing events. We provide a case study on the magnitude scale M w 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, which is the most thoroughly recorded earthquake event ever in the history. More than 400 stations recorded this event, and the readings from this event increased global strong-motion records five folds. Each station measured east-west, north-south, and vertical component of acceleration for approximately 90 seconds. The sensor network released the initial raw data within minutes after the Chi-Chi mainshock. It is essential to have a visualization system for fast data exploring and analyzing, offering crucial visual analytical information for scientists to make quick judgments. Raw data requires preprocessing before it can be rendered. We generated a sequence of ground-motion wave-field maps of 350 xc3x97 200 regular grid covers the entire Taiwan island from the sensor network readings. The result is a total of 1000 ground-motion wave-field maps with 0.1 second interval, forming a 1000 xc3x97 350 xc3x97 200 volume data set. We show that visualizing the time-varying component of the data spatially uncovers the changing features hidden in the data.",

This is especially challenging when the global data range is not known in advance, as is often the case in remote and in-situ visualization settings. Since the data range may vary dramatically as the simulation progresses, volume rendering using local transfer functions may not be coherent for all time steps. We present an exploratory technique that enables coherent classification of time-varying volume data. Unlike previous approaches, which require pre-processing of all time steps, our approach lets the user explore the transfer function space without accessing the original 3D data. This is useful for interactive visualization, and absolutely essential for in-situ visualization, where the entire simulation data range is not known in advance. Our approach generates a compact representation of each time step at rendering time in the form of ray attenuation functions, which are used for subsequent operations on the opacity and color mappings. The presented approach offers interactive exploration of time-varying simulation data that alleviates the cost associated with reloading and caching large data sets.",

A characterization of the visualization process is discussed, leading to a general model of the visualization exploration process.

This article describes such a system that's being developed jointly by the University of California, Davis, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The centralized system acts as a portal into grid-enabled visualization systems. Scientists using the portal can focus on the important task of extracting insights from their data through visualization instead of having to worry about process management. Because scientists at LBNL and their collaborators require access to the portal from around the world, the portal's interface is entirely Web-based. Authenticated users only need a standards-compliant Web browser to explore their data from anywhere in the world. The portal provides a Web-based interface not just for exploring but also for encapsulating visualization data. Encapsulating the process lets users reproduce the visualization results for validation or extend those results by continuing data exploration. We discuss the integration of our grid-enabled visualization server, the visualization Web application that performs the visualization session management, and the Web-based interface.",

Significant visualization research has focused on the generation of visualizations (the depiction); less effort has focused on the exploratory aspects of visualization (the process). However, without formal models of the process, visualization exploration sessions cannot be fully utilized to assist users and system designers. Toward this end, we introduce the P-Set model of visualization exploration for describing this process and a framework to encapsulate, share, and analyze visual explorations. In addition, systems utilizing the model and framework are more efficient as redundant exploration is avoided. Several examples drawn from visualization applications demonstrate these benefits.

Among various classification techniques, one very attractive and effective method is employing machine learning to classify the whole volume according to some minimum user input through an interactive brushing interface, where users paint directly on slices of the volume. For routine visualization tasks, we can thus reduce their cost if the visualization system can learn the tasks and apply the captured knowledge in future tasks. This paper presents an intelligent, interactive visualization system that supports FocusContext viewing of volume data. Features of interest should be the focal point of the visualization, and by applying appropriate rendering methods we are able to enhance these features and create more illustrative visualizations in a FocusContext style. We show with a set of case studies that it is possible to use machine learning to not only help classify volume but also better present the classified results.

First, it's desirable to directly turn the results of data exploration and visualization into animation content. Second, users can create a complex animation sequence by combining several simple effects. Such effects, and operators to combine them, are fine-tuned via an intuitive user interface.",

Direct volume rendering is used to depict the space-time relationships of numerical results and seismic readings. When earthquake simulation data are volume rendered, it reveals the sequence of seismic wave initiation, propagation, attenuation, and energy releasing events of fault ruptures so that the direction of seismic wave propagation can be observed. Both accelerograph readings and earthquake simulation data are used to generate a sequence of ground-motion maps. Stacking these maps up in sequence forms a volume data.

            "abstract": "Networked computers are subject to attack, misuse, and abuse. Organizations and individuals are making every effort to build and maintain trustworthy computing systems. The main strategy is to closely monitor and inspect network activities by collecting and analyzing data about the network traffic and the trails of system usage. The analysis usually requires large amounts of finely detailed, high-dimensional data to enable analysts to uncover hidden threats and make calculated predictions in a timely fashion. The traditional, signature-based and statistical methods are limited in their capability to cope with the large, evolving data and the dynamic nature of the Internet. Visualization proves effective to aid in understanding large, high-dimensional data commonly found in many demanding applications such as large-scale scientific simulations and biomedicine. There is thus a growing interest in the development of visualization methods as alternative or complementary solutions to the pressing cyber security problems (Brodley, Chan, Lippmann & Yurcik 2004, Ma, North & Yurcik 2005). The challenge is to develop new visual representations, layout methods, user interfaces, and interaction techniques that can effectively facilitate visual interrogation and communication of the vast amounts of cyber security information. Visual data analysis is inherently an iterative process, where each iteration provides more insight into the data being shown. A typical example of this process occurs with any type of overview plus detail visualization. Patterns in the overview tend to direct what the user chooses to view in more detail, and the detailed view can provide insight on regions of the overview. This drill-down process, starting at a high semantic level and progressing to more detailed views, creates a feedback loop as shown in Figure 1, which can lend itself well to visualizing the relationships between large number of objects, such as port and network scans. In most cases, different visual representations are needed for constructing these different views. In particular, each specific region of interest may be defined in a space of arbitrary dimensions. The challenge is thus to seek the best space and visual representation in that space for each type of analysis task. I show with three different tasks how visualization can assist in the analysis of computer network activities for detecting anomalies using the drill-down process.",

One class of this detailed data is consists of sets of different line types which should be visualized simultaneously to understand their relationships to one another. Examples include electric and magnetic field lines, velocity and vorticity field lines, or the trajectory paths of different particle types. The extreme size and high density of these datasets can overwhelm current visualization techniques by requiring too much memory, or too much compute time. Very dense lines can also result in unintelligible images where the depth relationships between the lines can not be conveyed with current methods. n To circumvent the pitfalls of current visualization technique with respect to difficult line-based data, the visualization techniques presented in this dissertation take into account perceptual issues. By providing the cues that the human visual system uses to resolve depth relationships, making use of the natural image processing capabilities of that system, and simulating real-world illumination, the visualization methods avoid ambiguity and present compelling images which are easily interpreted, and which reduce the likelihood of illusions. n Three visualization methods are presented, each with their own area of applicability. The first method efficiently combines two existing line rendering techniques, and is suitable for older machines with slower CPUs and graphics hardware with minimal texturing capabilities. The second method provides self-orienting geometry for texturing. It is appropriate for large datasets where the lines to be visualized project to be at least several pixels wide, and presents lines with the appearance of three dimensional tubes, but much more efficiently than using actual polygonal tubes, and with a greater degree of flexibility for taking full advantage of the sophisticated texturing capabilities of modern graphics hardware. The final visualization method is based on anisotropic volume rendering, and is appropriate for gigantic, very dense line datasets, where line thicknesses can range from one pixel to extremely sub-pixel. Together, these three methods cover a very broad range of dataset sizes, and are demonstrated for visualizing simulations of wake vortices around the tail of an airplane, electric and magnetic fields within a linear accelerator structures, and charged particle trajectories generated and influenced by those fields.",

Further, very dense or intertwined lines, rendered with traditional visualization techniques, can produce unintelligible results with unclear depth relationships between the lines and no sense of global structure. Our approach is to apply a lighting model to the lines and sample them into an anisotropic voxel representation based on spherical harmonics as a preprocessing step. Then we evaluate and render these voxels for a given view using traditional volume rendering. For extremely large line based datasets, conversion to anisotropic voxels reduces the overall storage and rendering for O(n) lines to O(1) with a large constant that is still small enough to allow meaningful visualization of the entire dataset at nearly interactive rates on a single commodity PC.",

When moving to parallel computation, not only does the code execution need to be considered but also communication between the different processes which can induce delays that are detrimental to performance. As the number of processes increases, so does the impact of the communication delays on performance. For large-scale parallel applications, it is critical to understand how the communication impacts performance in order to make the code more efficient. There are several tools available for visualizing program execution and communications on parallel systems. These tools generally provide either views which statistically summarize the entire program execution or process-centric views. However, process-centric visualizations do not scale well as the number of processes gets very large. In particular, the most common representation of parallel processes is a Gantt chart with a row for each process. As the number of processes increases, these charts can become difficult to work with and can even exceed screen resolution.

Transfer functions (TF) based on boundaries (insets on the left: top, 1D TF with gradient modulation, bottom, 2D TF of intensity vs. gradient magnitude) cannot separate the tumor from the vessels (where gradients are also strong). A transfer function based on occlusion separates the tumor from the vessels and the ventricular structures from skull and skin. Right: CT dataset with contrast agent. Classification is difficult due to overlap between bone and vessel structures (see red color in ribcage in the insets). An occlusion-based TF properly classifies bone and also highlights internal structures (blue). Abstractxe2x80x94Despite the ever-growing improvements on graphics processing units and computational power, classifying 3D volume data remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a new method for classifying volume data based on the ambient occlusion of voxels. This information stems from the observation that most volumes of a certain type, e.g., CT, MRI or flow simulation, contain occlusion patterns that reveal the spatial structure of their materials or features. Furthermore, these patterns appear to emerge consistently for different data sets of the same type. We call this collection of patterns the occlusion spectrum of a dataset. We show that using this occlusion spectrum leads to better two-dimensional transfer functions that can help classify complex data sets in terms of the spatial relationships among features. In general, the ambient occlusion of a voxel can be interpreted as a weighted average of the intensities in a spherical neighborhood around the voxel. Different weighting schemes determine the ability to separate structures of interest in the occlusion spectrum. We present a general methodology for finding such a weighting. We show results of our approach in 3D imaging for different applications, including brain and breast tumor detection and the visualization of turbulent flow.",

We present a new approach to the volume classification problem which couples machine learning and a painting metaphor to allow more sophisticated classification in an intuitive manner. The user works in the volume data space by directly painting on sample slices of the volume and the painted voxels are used in an iterative training process. The trained system can then classify the entire volume. Both classification and rendering can be hardware accelerated, providing immediate visual feedback as painting progresses. Such an intelligent system approach enables the user to perform classification in a much higher dimensional space without explicitly specifying the mapping for every dimension used.

Since these methods handle each time step separately, they do not use the coherency of the feature along the time dimension in the extraction process. In this paper, we present a prediction-correction method that uses a prediction step to make the best guess of the feature region in the subsequent time step, followed by growing and shrinking the border of the predicted region to coherently extract the actual feature of interest. This method makes use of the temporal-space coherency of the data to accelerate the extraction process while implicitly solving the tedious correspondence problem that previous methods focus on.

We show how interactivity and incorporation of multiple visualization techniques help overcome the problem of limited visualization dimensions and allow many types of uncertainty to be seen in correlation with other variables.",

One aspect of particular interest to scientists is the evolution of groups of dark matter particles, or halos, described by merger trees. However, in order to fully understand subtleties in the merger trees, other data types derived from the simulation must be incorporated as well. In this work, we develop a novel interactive linked-view visualization system that focuses on simultaneously exploring dark matter halos, their hierarchical evolution, corresponding particle data, and other quantitative information. We employ a parallel remote renderer and a local merger tree selection tool so that users can analyze large data sets interactively. This allows scientists to assess their simulation code, understand inconsistencies in extracted data, and intuitively understand simulation behavior on all scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through a set of case studies on large-scale cosmological data from the HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code) simulation framework.",

Furthermore, these patterns appear to emerge consistently for different data sets of the same type. We call this collection of patterns the occlusion spectrum of a dataset. We show that using this occlusion spectrum leads to better two-dimensional transfer functions that can help classify complex data sets in terms of the spatial relationships among features. In general, the ambient occlusion of a voxel can be interpreted as a weighted average of the intensities in a spherical neighborhood around the voxel. Different weighting schemes determine the ability to separate structures of interest in the occlusion spectrum. We present a general methodology for finding such a weighting.

When making decisions based on uncertain data, it is important to quantify and present to the analyst both the aggregated uncertainty of the results and the impact of the sources of that uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new framework to support uncertainty in the visual analytics process, through statistic methods such as uncertainty modeling, propagation and aggregation.

Although 2D scatterplots are ubiquitous due to their simplicity and familiarity, there are not a lot of variations on their basic metaphor.

We extend 2D scatterplots using sensitivity coefficients to highlight local variation of one variable with respect to another. When applied to a scatterplot, these sensitivities can be understood as velocities, and the resulting visualization resembles a flow field.

Alternatively, computer graphics and virtual reality camera motion planning is frequently focused on collision free movement in a virtual walkthrough. For semi-transparent, fuzzy, or blobby volume data the collision free objective becomes insufficient. Here, we provide a set of essential criteria focused on computing camera paths to establish effective animations of volume data. Our dynamic multi-criteria solver coupled with a force-directed routing algorithm enables rapid generation of camera paths. Once users review the resulting animation and evaluate the camera motion, they are able to determine how each criterion impacts path generation.

With volume ray casting, per-ray visibility histograms summarize the contribution of samples along each ray to the final image. By quantifying visibility for the region of interest, indicated by the PET data, occluding tissues can be made just transparent enough to give a clear view of the features in that region while preserving some context.

A cloud computing system is often comprised of a large number of parallel computing and storage devices. Monitoring the usage and performance of such a system is important for efficient operations, maintenance, and security. Tracing every application on a large cloud system is untenable due to scale and privacy issues. But profile data can be collected relatively efficiently by regularly sampling the state of the system, including properties such as CPU load, memory usage, network usage, and others, creating a set of multivariate time series for each system. Adequate tools for studying such large-scale, multidimensional data are lacking. In this paper, we present a visual based analysis approach to understanding and analyzing the performance and behavior of cloud computing systems. Our design is based on similarity measures and a layout method to portray the behavior of each compute node over time. When visualizing a large number of behavioral lines together, distinct patterns often appear suggesting particular types of performance bottleneck. The resulting system provides multiple linked views, which allow the user to interactively explore the data by examining the data or a selected subset at different levels of detail.

Now the user does not have to deal with the tedious task of making small changes to the transfer function parameters, but now he/she can rely on the system to perform these searches automatically. Our methodology can be easily deployed in most visualization systems and can be used together with traditional 1D opacity transfer functions based on scalar values, as well as with multidimensional transfer functions and other more sophisticated rendering algorithms.",

One promising approach is to process the data in parallel, and then extract and analyze only features of interest, reducing required memory space by several orders of magnitude for following visualization tasks. However, extracting volume features in parallel is a non-trivial task as features might span over multiple processors, and local partial features are only visible within their own processors. In this paper, we discuss how to generate and maintain connectivity information of features across different processors. Based on the connectivity information, partial features can be integrated, which makes it possible to extract and track features for large data in parallel.

Each run of a petascale simulation typically outputs several hundred terabytes of data to disk. Transferring data at this scale over wide-area networks to the scientist's laboratory for post-processing analysis is not an option. Even the data files may be transferred, existing desktop data analysis and visualization tools cannot effectively handle such large-scale data.

In our work, we advocate a user-centric approach to exploring 3D vector fields. Our method allows the user to sketch 2D curves for pattern matching in 2D and field lines clustering in 3D. Specifically, a 3D field line whose view-dependent 2D projection is most similar to the user drawing will be identified and utilized to extract all similar 3D field lines. Furthermore, we employ an automatic clustering method to generate field-line templates for the user to locate subfields of interest. This semi-automatic process leverages the user's knowledge about the flow field through intuitive user interaction, resulting in a promising alternative to existing flow visualization solutions.

The effectiveness of such a visual validation and analysis process mainly relies on a good strategy to categorize and visualize the lines. However, the sheer size of line data produced by state-of-the-art scientific simulations poses great challenges to preparing the data for visualization. In this paper, we present a parallelization design of regression model-based clustering to categorize large line data derived from detailed scientific simulations by leveraging the power of heterogeneous computers. This parallel clustering method employs the Expectation Maximization algorithm to iteratively approximate the optimal data partitioning. First, we use a sorted-balance algorithm to partition and distribute the lines with various lengths among multiple compute nodes. During the following iterative clustering process, regression model parameters are recovered based on the local lines on each individual node, with only a few inter-node message exchanges involved. Meanwhile, the workload of regression model computing is well balanced across the nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively categorize large line data in a scalable manner to concisely convey dynamic structures and interactions, leading to a visualization that captures salient features and suppresses visual clutter to facilitate scientific exploration of large line data.",

We achieve this by automatically extracting layers depicted in composited images. The layers can then be recombined in different ways to simulate opacity changes and recoloring of individual features. Our results demonstrate that explorable images are especially useful when the volume data is too large for interactive exploration, takes too long to render due to the underlying mesh structure or desired shading effect, or if the original volume data is not available.

One solution that meets these requirements is to store a compact intermediate representation of the data, instead of a 3D volume itself. Recent work explores the use of attenuation functions as a data representation that summarizes the distribution of attenuation along the rays. This representation goes beyond conventional static images and allows users to dynamically explore their data, for example, to change color and opacity parameters, without accessing the original 3D data. The computation and storage costs of this method may still be prohibitively expensive for large and time-varying data sets, thus limiting its applicability in the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for computing attenuation functions in parallel. We exploit the fact that the distribution of attenuation can be constructed recursively from a hierarchy of blocks or intervals of the data, which is a highly parallelizeable process. We have developed a library of routines that can be used in a distance visualization scenario or can be called directly from a simulation code to generate explorable images in-situ. Through a number of examples, we demonstrate the application of this work to large-scale scientific simulations in a real-world parallel environment with thousands of processors. We also explore various compression methods for reducing the size of the RAF. Finally, we present a method for computing an alternative RAF representation, which more closely encodes the actual distribution of samples along a ray, using kernel density estimation.",

However, the complex hybrid gridding paradigm poses challenges to rendering calculations for visualizing the data. This paper describes a volume visualization system for time-varying adaptive moving-body CFD datasets, where the grid system consists of unstructured grids near the body surface, coupled with Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (SAMR) grid in the off-body domain. We present two approaches to the hybrid-grid volume ray casting: a KD-tree based single-pass algorithm, and a multi-pass algorithm using the depth peeling technique. The system has a three-level memory hierarchy: GPU memory, main memory, and a solid state drive (SSD). Through data caching and prefetching within the memory hierarchy, the latency of time-step swapping can be hidden.

Many networks contain static information, but some are constantly evolving making analysis hard. Even datasets that are not naturally networks can be transformed into networks which can reveal interesting patterns. And some networks have relatively simple structures, but have underlying temporal activity that can be difficult to analyze through traditional methods. This dissertation research presents new methods for time and space efficient visualization of traditional and time varying networks, methods for transforming sets of time-series data into networks that can be analyzed through these methods, and methods for visualizing the temporal activity of complex yet topologically static networks.",

This presents a challenge for volume rendering methods to produce images with unambiguous depth-ordering perception. Existing methods use visual cues such as halos and shadows to enhance depth perception. Along with other limitations, these methods introduce redundant information and require additional overhead. This paper presents a new approach to enhancing depth-ordering perception of volume rendered images without using additional visual cues. We set up an energy function based on quantitative perception models to measure the quality of the images in terms of the effectiveness of depth-ordering and transparency perception as well as the faithfulness of the information revealed. Guided by the function, we use a conjugate gradient method to iteratively and judiciously enhance the results. Our method can complement existing systems for enhancing volume rendering results. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.",

Gradient estimation is necessary for rendering shaded isosurfaces and specular highlights, which provide important cues for shape and depth. Gradient estimation has been widely studied and deployed for regular-grid volume data to achieve local illumination effects, but has been, otherwise, for unstructured-mesh data. As a result, most of the unstructured-mesh volume visualizations made so far were unlit. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of gradient estimation methods for unstructured meshes with respect to their cost and performance. Through a number of benchmarks, we discuss the effects of mesh quality and scalar function complexity in the accuracy of the reconstruction, and their impact in lighting-enabled volume rendering. Based on our study, we also propose two heuristic improvements to the gradient reconstruction process. The first heuristic improves the rendering quality with a hybrid algorithm that combines the results of the multiple reconstruction methods, based on the properties of a given mesh. The second heuristic improves the efficiency of its GPU implementation, by restricting the computation of the gradient on a fixed-size local neighborhood.",

Interactive volume rendering incorporated with advanced lighting has been achieved with GPU acceleration for regular-grid volume data, making volume visualization even more appealing as a tool for 3D data exploration. This paper presents an interactive illumination strategy, which is specially designed and optimized for volume visualization of unstructured-grid data. The basis of the design is a partial differential equation based illumination model to simulate the light propagation, absorption, and scattering within the volumetric medium. In particular, a two-level scheme is introduced to overcome the challenges presented by unstructured grids. Test results show that the added illumination effects such as global shadowing and multiple scattering not only lead to more visually pleasing visualization, but also greatly enhance the perception of the depth information and complex spatial relationships for features of interest in the volume data. This volume visualization enhancement is introduced at a time when unstructured grids are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of scientific simulation applications.",

Timeline visualizations are widely used to illustrate interactions among different entities over time. This type of visualizations facilitate reviewing important activities and their associations. For a long timeline, however, it is difficult for the viewer to remember all the essential information found in the visualization process. Since hearing is another primary human sense for perceiving information, we conjecture that adding audio annotations to selected sections of a timeline visualization can help improve the viewer's recall of important events. We have designed a user study based on augmenting storyline visualizations with verbal text, and tested subjects with three different settings: visual cues only, verbal text only, and both. While our test results do not give a strong indication of the clear advantage of adding verbal text, the lessons learned in our study suggest directions for further study and will help us and others design audio-augmented visualization systems.",

This paper presents a study on the design of online guides that educate new users on how to utilize information visualizations, particularly focusing on the employment of exercise questions in the guides. We use two concepts from educational psychology, learning type (or learning style) and teaching method, to design four unique types of online guides. The effects of the guides are measured by comprehension tests of a large group of crowdsourced participants. The tests covered four visualization types (graph, scatter plot, storyline, and tree map) and a complete range of visual analytics tasks. Our statistical analyses indicate that online guides which employ active learning and the top-down teaching method are the most effective. Our study provides quantitative insight into the use of exercise questions in online guides for information visualizations and will inspire further research on design considerations for other elements in introductory materials.",

However, designing interactive visualizations for informal learning environments, such as museums, presents several challenges. First, visualizations must engage visitors on a personal level. Second, visitors often lack the background to interpret visualizations of scientific data. Third, visitors have very limited time at individual exhibits in museums. This paper examines these design considerations through the iterative development and evaluation of an interactive exhibit as a visualization tool that gives museumgoers access to scientific data generated and used by researchers. The exhibit prototype, Living Liquid, encourages visitors to ask and answer their own questions while exploring the time-varying global distribution of simulated marine microbes using a touchscreen interface. Iterative development proceeded through three rounds of formative evaluations using think-aloud protocols and interviews, each round informing a key visualization design decision: (1) what to visualize to initiate inquiry, (2) how to link data at the microscopic scale to global patterns, and (3) how to include additional data that allows visitors to pursue their own questions. Data from visitor evaluations suggests that, when designing visualizations for public audiences, one should (1) avoid distracting visitors from data that they should explore, (2) incorporate background information into the visualization, (3) favor understandability over scientific accuracy, and (4) layer data accessibility to structure inquiry. Lessons learned from this case study add to our growing understanding of how to use visualizations to actively engage learners with scientific data.",

In this paper, we present a new design concept, engagement-versatile design, for visualizations that target users with a variety of engagement styles. Without losing generality, we demonstrate the feasibility of this concept through the designing of a system called Stock Lamp, an engagement-versatile visualization that helps users keep track of the stock market in real-time. This design process includes identifying different modes of engagement, deriving design implications from each engagement-mode, and applying them to the visualization's design. Our user study shows that Stock Lamp is able to consistently relay market information even when the users are multi-tasking. We believe this study establishes a new concept that promotes a systematic design approach that leverages both theoretical and empirical design methodologies for future visualization development.",

            "abstract": "Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is a crucial tool to facilitate high-dimensional data analysis. As the volume and the variety of features used to describe a phenomenon keeps increasing, DR has become not only desirable but paramount. However, DR can result in unreliable depictions of data. The uncertainties involved in DR may stem from the selection of methods, parameter configurations, and the constraints imposed by the user. To address these uncertainties, various means of DR quality assessment have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, how to optimize the trade-off between the quantification efficiency and accuracy is yet to be further studied. The purpose of this paper is to present a general technique, in the context of visual analytics, to support efficient uncertainty-aware high-dimensional data exploration. We model the uncertainty based on how well neighborhood geometries are preserved during DR. We employ approximated nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms to speed up the quantification process with marginal decrease in accuracy. We then visualize the quantified uncertainties in the form of augmented scatter plot. We test our technique with three real world datasets against several well-known DR techniques, and discuss possible underlying causes that lead to certain embedding patterns. Our results show that our approach is effective and beneficial for both DR assessment and user-centered data exploration.",

However, visualization tools that rapidly quantify simulation uncertainty may require precise tuning, give limited information, or struggle to disentangle uncertainty sources. We propose a fast, scalable regression-based approach that uses bootstrapping on small samples of simulation data to model the effect of uncertainty from discreteness. We test the approach on three types of simulations with unique sources of uncertainty: particles (dark matter), ensembles (ocean), and discretized flows (traffic). We create a visualization tool to facilitate this modeling, showing training data and predictions in real time. Scientists, who need to provide only modest supervision, can use our tool to quickly understand how initial conditions and parameterizations affect observable quantities, their uncertainties, and their agreement with experimental data. We show that our tool offers a speedup of several orders of magnitude over comparable uncertainty calculation approaches.",

Our method models light propagation, including both absorption and scattering, in a volume using a convection-diffusion equation that can be solved numerically. The main advantage of such technique is that the light modeling and simulation can be separated, where we can use a unified partial-differential equation to model various illumination effects, and adopt highly-parallelized grid-based numerical schemes to solve it. Results show that our method can achieve high quality volume illumination with dynamic color and opacity mapping and various light sources in real-time.

In addition, the problem becomes even more challenging when the dynamic data records have a varying number of dimensions as often found in real-world applications. This paper presents an incremental DR solution. We enhance an existing incremental PCA method in several ways to ensure its usability for visualizing streaming multidimensional data. First, we use geometric transformation and animation methods to help preserve a viewer's mental map when visualizing the incremental results. Second, to handle data dimension variants, we use an optimization method to estimate the projected data positions, and also convey the resulting uncertainty in the visualization.

We present the design and evaluation of a visual interface that assists users to employ commonly used data anonymization techniques for making privacy preserving visualizations of the data. We focus on event sequence data due to its vulnerability to privacy concerns. Our visual interface is designed for data owners to examine potential privacy issues, obfuscate information as suggested by the algorithm, and fine-tune the results per their requests.

To deal with this problem, we generalize conventional data anonymization models (originally designed for relational data) and formally apply them in the context of privacy preserving ontological network visualization. We use these models to identify the privacy leaks that exist in a visualization, provide graph modification actions that remove and/or perceptually minimize the effect of the identified leaks, and discuss strategies for what types of privacy actions to choose depending on the context of the leaks.

            "abstract": "Using different methods for laying out a graph can lead to very different visual appearances, with which the viewer perceives different information. Selecting a xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users.",

            "abstract": "Different layouts can characterize different aspects of the same graph. Finding a xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d layout of a graph is thus an important task for graph visualization. In practice, users often visualize a graph in multiple layouts by using different methods and varying parameter settings until they find a layout that best suits the purpose of the visualization. However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined heuristics.",

To interactively analyze and explore big data, progressive analytics and visualization methods have recently emerged. Progressive visualizations of incrementally refining results have the advantages of allowing users to steer the analysis process and make early decisions. P5 leverages declarative grammar for specifying visualization designs and exploits GPU computing to accelerate progressive data processing and rendering. The declarative specifications can be modified during progressive processing to create different visualizations for analyzing the intermediate results. To enable user interactions for progressive data analysis, P5 utilizes the GPU to automatically aggregate and index data based on declarative interaction specifications to facilitate effective interactive visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of P5 through a variety of example applications and several performance benchmark tests.",

            "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction (DR) is frequently used for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data as it provides a good first glance of the data. However, to interpret the DR result for gaining useful insights from the data, it would take additional analysis effort such as identifying clusters and understanding their characteristics. While there are many automatic methods (e.g., density-based clustering methods) to identify clusters, effective methods for understanding a cluster's characteristics are still lacking. A cluster can be mostly characterized by its distribution of feature values. Reviewing the original feature values is not a straightforward task when the number of features is large. To address this challenge, we present a visual analytics method that effectively highlights the essential features of a cluster in a DR result. To extract the essential features, we introduce an enhanced usage of contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA). Our method, called ccPCA (contrasting clusters in PCA), can calculate each feature's relative contribution to the contrast between one cluster and other clusters. With ccPCA, we have created an interactive system including a scalable visualization of clusters' feature contributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and system with case studies using several publicly available datasets.",
