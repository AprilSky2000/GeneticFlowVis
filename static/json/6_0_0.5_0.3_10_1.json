Visualization techniques may help in database exploration by providing a comprehensive overview of the database. Pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been developed to visualize as many data items as possible on the display at one point of time. The basic idea of pixeloriented techniques is to map each data value to a colored pixel and present the data values belonging to different dimensions (attributes) in separate subwindows. In case of the query-dependent techniques, the pixels are arranged and colored according to the relevance for the query, providing a visual impression of the query result and of its relevance with respect to the query. One problem of the current query-dependent pixel-oriented visualization techniques is that their local clustering properties are insufficient. In this paper, we therefore generalize the original pixel-oriented techniques and propose new variants which retain the overall arrangement but enhance the clustering properties by using screen-filling curves locally. Different screen-filling curves (Snake, Peano-Hilbert, Morton) with different sizes (2, 4, 8, 16) may be used. We evaluate the possible variants and compare the resulting visualizations. The visualizations show that screen-filling curves clearly enhance the visual clustering of query-dependent pixel-oriented visualization techniques, but it also becomes clear that there is no significant difference between the different screen-filling curves.",

In this article, we describe and evaluate a new visualization-based approach to mining large databases. The basic idea of our visual data mining techniques is to represent as many data items as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. The major goal of this article is to evaluate our visual data mining techniques and to compare them to other well-known visualization techniques for multidimensional data: the parallel coordinate and stick-figure visualization techniques. For the evaluation of visual data mining techniques, the perception of data properties counts most, while the CPU time and the number of secondary storage accesses are only of secondary importance. In addition to testing the visualization techniques using real data, we developed a testing environment for database visualizations similar to the benchmark approach used for comparing the performance of database systems. The testing environment allows the generation of test data sets with predefined data characteristics which are important for comparing the perceptual abilities of visual data mining techniques.",

In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called a 'recursive pattern', which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may greatly influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the 'recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our 'recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.",

The basic idea of the xe2x80x98circle segmentsxe2x80x99 visualization technique is to display the data dimensions as segments of a circle. If the data consists of k dimensions, the circle is partitioned into k segments, each representing one data dimension. Inside the segments, the data values belonging to one dimension are arranged from the center of the circle to the outside in a back and forth manner orthogonal to the line that halves the segment. Our first results show that the xe2x80x98circle segmentxe2x80x99 technique is very powerful for visualizing large amounts of data, providing more expressive visualizations than other wellknown techniques such as the xe2x80x98recursive patternxe2x80x99 technique and traditional xe2x80x98line graphsxe2x80x99.",

We describe a systematic approach to arrange the dimensions according to their similarity. The basic idea is to rearrange the data dimensions such that dimensions showing a similar behavior are positioned next to each other. For the similarity clustering of dimensions, we need to define similarity measures which determine the partial or global similarity of dimensions. We then consider the problem of finding an optimal one- or two-dimensional arrangement of the dimensions based on their similarity. Theoretical considerations show that both, the one- and the two-dimensional arrangement problem are surprisingly hard problems, i.e. they are NP complete. Our solution of the problem is therefore based on heuristic algorithms. An empirical evaluation using a number of different visualization techniques shows the high impact of our similarity clustering of dimensions on the visualization results.",

Often a large number of time series have to be monitored and analyzed in parallel. Sets of time series may show intrinsic hierarchical relationships and varying degrees of importance among the individual time series. Effective techniques for visually analyzing large sets of time series should encode the relative importance and hierarchical ordering of the time series data by size and position, and should also provide a high degree of regularity in order to support comparability by the analyst. In this paper, we present a framework for visualizing large sets of time series. Based on the notion of inter time series importance relationships, we define a set of objective functions that space-filling layout schemes for time series data should obey. We develop an efficient algorithm addressing the identified problems by generating layouts that reflect hierarchy and importance based relationships in a regular layout with favorable aspect ratios. We apply our technique to a number of real world data sets including sales and stock data, and we compare our technique with an aspect ratio aware variant of the well known TreeMap algorithm. The examples show the advantages and practical usefulness of our layout algorithm.",

We propose a framework for intelligent time- and data-dependent visual aggregation of data along multiple resolution levels. This idea leads to effective visualization support for long time-series data providing both focus and context. The basic idea of the technique is that either data-dependent or application-dependent, display space is allocated in proportion to the degree of interest of data subintervals, thereby (a) guiding the user in perceiving important information, and (b) freeing required display space to visualize all the data. The automatic part of the framework can accommodate any time series analysis algorithm yielding a numeric degree of interest scale. We apply our techniques on real-world data sets, compare it with the standard visualization approach, and conclude the usefulness and scalability of the approach.",

RPV provides an effective visual representation of locality and periodicity of the high volume, multivariate data streams. RPVs may have an additional analysis ring for highlighting the results of correlation analysis or peak point detection. Our real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

By observing which independent visual variables can change in each method, we described how these changes are related to the attribute and structure changes that can occur in the data stream. Most of the changes in the data stream lead to potential loss of temporal and relational context between the new data and the past data.

The main goal is to compare continuous data changing their characteristics over time in order to identify patterns, exceptions and similarities in the data.To achieve this goal Circle View is a intuitive and easy to understand visualization interface to enable the user very fast to acquire the information needed. This is an important feature for fast changing visualization caused by time related data streams. Circle View supports the visualization of the changing characteristics over time, to allow the user the observation of changes in the data. Additionally it provides user interaction and drill down mechanism depending on user demands for a effective exploratory data analysis. There is also the capability of exploring correlations and exceptions in the data by using similarity and ordering algorithms.",

But the ever increasing mass of information leads to new challenges on pixel-based techniques and concepts, since the volume, complexity and dynamic nature of today's scientific and commercial data sets are beyond the capability of many of current presentation techniques. Most existing pixel based approaches do not scale well on such large data sets as visual representation suffers from the high number of relevant data points, that might be even higher than the available monitor resolution and does therefore not allow a direct mapping of all data points to pixels on the display. In this paper we focuses on ways to increase the scalability of pixel based approaches by integrating relevance driven techniques into the visualization process.

Our visualization techniques which have been developed to support querying large scientific databases are designed to visualize as many data items as possible on current display de vices. Even if we are able to use each pixel of the display device to visualize one data value, the number of data items that can be visualized is quite limited. Therefore, in our system we consider only those data items which are xe2x80x98closexe2x80x99 to a user -specified query. The data items are arranged according to their distance from the query. Multiple windows are used for the different attributes of the data and the distance of each of the attributes from the query is represented by color. After briefly describing the basic ideas of our visualization techniques, in this paper we focus on tw o specific issues which arise in connection with our visualization techniques: First, we compare the data space which is the amount of information available in the database to the visualization space which is the amount of information that can be visualized by our visualization techniques. Second, we discuss the usefulness of different color models for our distance-to-color mapping and define a ne w color model which produces adequate color scales.",

Bar charts are widely used for daily analysis, but only show highly aggregated data. Users often need to visualize detailed multidimensional information reflecting the health of their businesses. In this paper, we propose an innovative visualization solution based on the use of value cells within bar charts to represent business metrics. The value of a transaction can be discretized into one or multiple cells: high-value transactions are mapped to multiple value cells, whereas many small-value transactions are combined into one cell. With value-cell bar charts, users can 1) visualize transaction value distributions and correlations, 2) identify high-value transactions and outliers at a glance, and 3) instantly display values at the transaction record level. Value-cell bar charts have been applied with success to different sales and IT service usage applications, demonstrating the benefits of the technique over traditional charting techniques. A comparison with two variants of the well-known Tree map technique and our earlier work on pixel bar charts is also included.",

            "abstract": "During the last two decades a wide variety of advanced methods for the visual exploration of large data sets have been proposed. For most of these techniques user interaction has become a crucial element, since there are many situations in which a user or an analyst has to select the right parameter settings from among many or select a subset of the available attribute space for the visualization process, in order to construct valuable visualizations that provide insight, into the data and reveal interesting patterns. The right choice of input parameters is often essential, since suboptimal parameter settings or the investigation of irrelevant data dimensions make the exploration process more time consuming and may result in wrong conclusions. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatically determining meaningful parameter- and attribute settings based on the information content of the resulting visualizations. Our technique called Pixnostics, in analogy to Scagnostics (Wilkinson et al., 2005), automatically analyses pixel images resulting from diverse parameter mappings and ranks them according to the potential value for the user. This allows a more effective and more efficient visual data analysis process, since the attribute/parameter space is reduced to meaningful selections and thus the analyst obtains faster insight into the data. Real world applications are provided to show the benefit of the proposed approach",

This paper introduces a novel approach to represent spatial data changing over time by plotting a number of non-overlapping pixels, close to the sensor positions in a map. Thereby, we encode the amount of time that a subject spent at a particular sensor to the number of plotted pixels. Color is used in a twofold manner; while distinct colors distinguish between sensor nodes in different regions, the colors' intensity is used as an indicator to the temporal property of the subjects' activity. The resulting visualization technique, called growth ring maps, enables users to find similarities and extract patterns of interest in spatiotemporal data by using humans' perceptual abilities. We demonstrate the newly introduced technique on a dataset that shows the behavior of healthy and Alzheimer transgenic, male and female mice. We motivate the new technique by showing that the temporal analysis based on hierarchical clustering and the spatial analysis based on transition matrices only reveal limited results. Results and findings are cross-validated using multidimensional scaling. While the focus of this paper is to apply our visualization for monitoring animal behavior, the technique is also applicable for analyzing data, such as packet tracing, geographic monitoring of sales development, or mobile phone capacity planning.",

But the ever increasing mass of information leads to new challenges on visualization techniques and concepts. Due to technological progress in computer power and storage capacity today's scientiflc and commercial applications are capable of generating, storing and processing massive amounts of data. Most exist- ing visualization metaphors and concepts do not scale well on such large data sets as interaction capabilities and visual representations sufier from the massive number of data points.

In this context the paper introduces a new approach based on a Multiresolution paradigm to increase the scalability of existing Visual data exploration techniques. The basic idea is to provide relevance driven compact representations of the underlying data set that present the data at difierent granularities. In the visualization step the available display space is then distributed according to the data granularity, to emphasize relevant information.

The basic idea is to distort a map by resizing its regions according to a statistical parameter, but in a way that keeps the map recognizable. We formally define a family of cartogram drawing problems. We show that even simple variants are unsolvable in the general case. Because the feasible variants are NP-complete, heuristics are needed to solve the problem. Previously proposed solutions suffer from problems with the quality of the generated drawings. For a cartogram to be recognizable, it is important to preserve the global shape or outline of the input map, a requirement that has been overlooked in the past. To address this, our objective function for cartogram drawing includes both global and local shape preservation. To measure the degree of shape preservation, we propose a shape similarity function, which is based on a Fourier transformation of the polygons' curvatures. Also, our application is visualization of dynamic data, for which we need an algorithm that recalculates a cartogram in a few seconds. None of the previous algorithms provides adequate performance with an acceptable level of quality for this application. We therefore propose an efficient iterative scanline algorithm to reposition edges while preserving local and global shapes. Scanlines may be generated automatically or entered interactively to guide the optimization process more closely. We apply our algorithm to several example data sets and provide a detailed comparison of the two variants of our algorithm and previous approaches.",

The analysis of such data presents a great challenge. General tasks involve clustering, categorization, and searching for patterns of interest for sociological or economic research. Available visual encodings and screen space limitations lead to over-plotting and hiding of patterns and clusters in densely populated areas, while sparsely populated areas waste space and draw the attention away from the areas of interest. In this paper, two new approaches (RadialScale and AngularScale) are introduced to create density-equalized maps, while preserving recognizable features and neighborhoods in the visualization. These approaches build the core of a multi-scal- ing technique based on local features of the data described as local minima and maxima of point density. Scaling is conducted several times around these features, which leads to more homogeneous distortions. Results are illustrated using several real-world datasets. Our evaluation shows that the proposed techniques outperform traditional techniques as regard the homogeneity of the resulting data distributions and therefore build a more appropriate basis for analytic purposes.",

In many application domains, this data is collected and indexed by geo-spatial location. The discovery of interesting patterns in such databases through visual analytics is a key to turn this data into valuable information. Challenges arise because newly available geo-spatial data sets often have millions of records, or even far more, they are from multiple and heterogeneous data sources, and the output devices have significantly changed, e.g. high-resolution pixilated displays are increasingly available in both wall-sized and desktop units . New techniques are needed to cope with this scale. In this paper we focus on ways to increase the scalability of pixel-based visual interfaces by adding task on hands scenarios that tightly integrate the data analyst into the exploration of geo-spatial data sets.",

            "abstract": "Visual data analysis of time related data sets has attracted much research interest recently, and a number of sophisticated visualization methods have been proposed in the past. In financial analysis, however, the most important and most common visualization techniques for time series data is the traditional line- or bar chart. Although these are intuitive and make it easy to spot the effect of key events on a asset's price, and its return over a given period of time, price charts do not allow the easy perception of relative movements in terms of growth rates, which is the key feature of any price-related time series.n n This paper presents a novel Growth Matrix visualization technique for analyzing assets. It extends the ability of existing chart techniques by not only visualizing asset return rates over fixed time frames, but over the full spectrum of all subintervals present in a given time frame, in a single view. At the same time, the technique allows a comparison of subinterval return rates among groups of even a few hundreds of assets. This provides a powerful way for analyzing financial data, since it allows the identification of strong and weak periods of assets as compared to global market characteristics, and thus allows a more encompassing visual classification into good and poor performers than existing chart techniques. We illustrate the technique by real-world examples showing the abilities of the new approach, and its high relevance for financial analysis tasks.",

International agencies collect thousands of news every day from a large number of sources and making sense of them is becoming increasingly complex due to the rate of the incoming news, as well as the inherent complexity of analyzing large quantities of evolving text corpora. Current visual techniques that deal with temporal evolution of such complex datasets, together with research efforts in related domains like text mining and topic detection and tracking, represent early attempts to understand, gain insight and make sense of these data. Despite these initial propositions, there is still a lack of techniques dealing directly with the problem of visualizing news streams in a on-line fashion, that is, in a way that the evolution of news can be monitored in real-time by the operator. In this paper we propose a purely visual technique that permits to see the evolution of news in real-time. The technique permits to show the stream of news as they enter into the system as well as a series of important threads which are computed on the fly. By merging single articles into threads, the technique permits to offload the visualization and retain only the most relevant information. The proposed technique is applied to the visualization of news streams generated by a news aggregation system that monitors over 4000 sites from 1600 key news portals world-wide and retrieves over 80000 reports per day in 43 languages.",

By mapping data to visual representations and providing interactive tools to explore and navigate, it is possible to get an understanding of the data and possibly discover new knowledge. With the advent of modern data collection and analysis technologies, the direct visualization of data starts to show its limitations due to limited scalability in terms of volumes and to the complexity of required analytical reasoning. Many analytical problems we encounter today require approaches that go beyond pure analytics or pure visualization. Visual analytics provides an answer to this problems by advocating a tight integration between automatic computation and interactive visualization, proposing a more holistic approach. In this paper, we argue for Advanced Visual Analytics Interfaces (AVAIs), visual interfaces in which neither the analytics nor the visualization needs to be advanced in itself but where the synergy between automation and visualization is in fact advanced. We offer a detailed argumentation around the needs and challenges of AVAIs and provide several examples of this type of interfaces.",

Analysts want to identify the causes and impacts of these interesting areas, and they also want to search for similar patterns occurring elsewhere in the data set. In this paper we introduce the Intelligent Visual Analytics Query (IVQuery) concept that combines visual interaction with automated analytical methods to support analysts in discovering the special properties and relations of identified patterns. The idea of IVQuery is to interactively select focus areas in the visualization. Then, according to the characteristics of the selected areas, such as the data dimensions and records, IVQuery employs analytical methods to identify the relationships to other portions of the data set. Finally, IVQuery generates visual representations for analysts to view and refine the results. IVQuery has been applied successfully to different real-world data sets, such as data warehouse performance, product sales, and sever performance analysis, and demonstrates the benefits of this technique over traditional filtering and zooming techniques. The visual analytics query technique can be used with many different types of visual representation. In this paper we show how to use IVQuery with parallel coordinates, visual maps, and scatter plots.",

The data analysts want to catch problems in flight to reveal the root cause of anomalies. Immediate actions need to be taken before the problems become too expensive or consume too many resources. In the meantime, analysts need to have the big picture of what the information is about. In this paper, we derive and analyze two real-time visualization techniques for managing density displays: (1) circular overlay displays which visualize large volumes of data without data shift movements after the display is full, thus freeing the analyst from adjusting the mental picture of the data after each data shift; and (2) variable resolution density displays which allow users to get the entire view without cluttering. We evaluate these techniques with respect to a number of evaluation measures, such as constancy of the display and usage of display space, and compare them to conventional displays with periodic shifts. Our real time data monitoring system also provides advanced interactions such as a local root cause analysis for further exploration. The applications using a number of real-world data sets show the wide applicability and usefulness of our ideas.",

This paper presents a system to tackle some of the visualization challenges when analyzing such dynamic event data streams. In particular, we introduce the Event Visualizer, which is a loosely coupled modular system for collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing dynamic real-time event data streams. Due to the variety of different analysis tasks the system provides an extensible framework with several interactive linked visualizations to focus on different aspects of the event data stream.

By analyzing the news feeds, we want to find out which topics are important in different countries and what is the general polarity of the articles within these topics. To assess the polarity of a news article, automatic techniques for polarity analysis are employed and the results are represented using Literature Fingerprinting for visualization. In the spatial description of the news feeds, every article can be represented by two geographic attributes, the news origin and the location of the event itself. In order to assess these spatial properties of news articles, we conducted our geo-analysis, which is able to cope with the size and spatial distribution of the data.

Interviews with experts identified possible aspects of a text (such as 'is it hard to read?') and a set of features were devised (such as linguistic complexity, story complexity, genre) which combine to characterize these age related aspects. In order to measure these properties, we map a set of text features onto each one. An evaluation of the measures, using Amazon Mechanical Turk, showed promising results. Finally, the set features are visualized in our age-suitability tool, which gives the user the possibility to explore the results, supporting transparency and traceability as well as the opportunity to deal with the limitations of automatic methods and computability issues.",

Traditionally, node-link diagrams are used to depict the social network of a novel. However, static graphs can only visualize the overall social network structure but not the development of the networks over the course of the story, while dynamic graphs have the serious problem that there are many sudden changes between different portions of the overall social network. In this paper we explore means to show the relationships between the characters of a plot and at the same time their development over the course of a novel. Based on a careful exploration of the design space, we suggest a new visualization technique called Fingerprint Matrices. A case study exemplifies the usage of Fingerprint Matrices and shows that they are an effective means to analyze prose literature with respect to the development of relationships between the different characters.",

Unfortunately, only the text terms that are explicitly or implicitly linked with the images are used for image indexing but the associated text terms may not have exact correspondence with the underlying image semantics, thus the keyword-based Google images search engine may return large amounts of junk images which are irrelevant to the given keyword-based queries. Based on this observation, we have developed an interactive approach to filter out the junk images from keyword-based Google images search results and our approach consists of the following major components. a) A kernel-based image clustering technique is developed to partition the returned images into multiple clusters and outliers. b) Hyperbolic visualization is incorporated to display large amounts of returned images according to their nonlinear visual similarity contexts, so that users can assess the relevance between the returned images and their real query intentions interactively and select one or multiple images to express their query intentions and personal preferences precisely. c) An incremental kernel learning algorithm is developed to translate the users' query intentions and personal preferences for updating the mixture-of-kernels and generating better hypotheses to achieve more accurate clustering of the returned images and filter out the junk images more effectively. Experiments on diverse keyword-based queries from Google images search engine have obtained very positive results.

A well-known problem is that scatter plots often have a high degree of overlap, which may occlude a significant portion of the data values shown. In this paper, we propose the generalized scatter plot technique, which allows an overlap-free representation of large data sets to fit entirely into the display. The basic idea is to allow the analyst to optimize the degree of overlap and distortion to generate the bestpossible view. To allow an effective usage, we provide the capability to zoom smoothly between the traditional and our generalized scatter plots. We identify an optimization function that takes overlap and distortion of the visualization into acccount. We evaluate the generalized scatter plots according to this optimization function, and show that there usually exists an optimal compromise between overlap and distortion. Our generalized scatter plots have been applied successfully to a number of real-world IT services applications, such as server performance monitoring, telephone service usage analysis and financial data, demonstrating the benefits of the generalized scatter plots over traditional ones.",

In a sense, visualizations in combination with analytical processes could be a viable method for such tasks because it can be used to analyze the sheer amounts of text streams. However, data analysts and visualization experts often face grand challenges stemming out of the ill-defined concept of event and various kinds of textual data. As a result, we have few guidelines on how to build successful visual analysis tools that can handle specific event types and diverse textual data sources. Our goal is to take the first step towards answering the question by organizing insights from prior research studies on event detection and visual analysis.

However, while most visual analysis techniques support the analysis of short time periods, e.g. one day or one week, they fail to visualize large-scale time series, ranging over one year or more. In our approach we present a time series matrix visualization that tackles this problem. Its primary advantages are that it scales to a large number of time series with different start and end points and allows for the visual comparison / correlation analysis of a set of influencing factors.

For example, to monitor computer network traffic a dynamic set of hosts and their peer-to-peer connections on different ports must be analysed. A matrix visualization focused on the display of one matrix at a time cannot cope with this task.",

            "abstract": "In many application areas, the key to successful data analysis is the integrated analysis of heterogeneous data. One example is the financial domain, where time-dependent and highly frequent quantitative data (e.g., trading volume and price information) and textual data (e.g., economic and political news reports) need to be considered jointly. Data analysis tools need to support an integrated analysis, which allows studying the relationships between textual news documents and quantitative properties of the stock market price series. In this paper, we describe a workflow and tool that allows a flexible formation of hypotheses about text features and their combinations, which reflect quantitative phenomena observed in stock data. To support such an analysis, we combine the analysis steps of frequent quantitative and text-oriented data using an existing a-priori method. First, based on heuristics we extract interesting intervals and patterns in large time series data. The visual analysis supports the analyst in exploring parameter combinations and their results. The identified time series patterns are then input for the second analysis step, in which all identified intervals of interest are analyzed for frequent patterns co-occurring with financial news. An a-priori method supports the discovery of such sequential temporal patterns. Then, various text features like the degree of sentence nesting, noun phrase complexity, the vocabulary richness, etc. are extracted from the news to obtain meta patterns. Meta patterns are defined by a specific combination of text features which significantly differ from the text features of the remaining news data. Our approach combines a portfolio of visualization and analysis techniques, including time-, cluster- and sequence visualization and analysis functionality. We provide two case studies, showing the effectiveness of our combined quantitative and textual analysis work flow. The workflow can also be generalized to other application domains such as data analysis of smart grids, cyber physical systems or the security of critical infrastructure, where the data consists of a combination of quantitative and textual time series data.",

Dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and MDS allow analysis and visualization of multivariate data, but per se do not provide means to explore multivariate patterns over time. We propose Temporal Multidimensional Scaling (TMDS), a novel visualization technique that computes temporal one-dimensional MDS plots for multivariate data which evolve over time. Using a sliding window approach, MDS is computed for each data window separately, and the results are plotted sequentially along the time axis, taking care of plot alignment. Our TMDS plots enable visual identification of patterns based on multidimensional similarity of the data evolving over time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in the field of network security and show in two case studies how users can iteratively explore the data to identify previously unknown, temporally evolving patterns.",

For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a xe2x80x9chuman in the loopxe2x80x9d process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems.

We present a multi-stage Visual Analytics (VA) approach for iterative cluster refinement together with an implementation (SOMFlow) that uses Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to analyze time series data. It supports exploration by offering the analyst a visual platform to analyze intermediate results, adapt the underlying computations, iteratively partition the data, and to reflect previous analytical activities. The history of previous decisions is explicitly visualized within a flow graph, allowing to compare earlier cluster refinements and to explore relations. We further leverage quality and interestingness measures to guide the analyst in the discovery of useful patterns, relations, and data partitions. We conducted two pair analytics experiments together with a subject matter expert in speech intonation research to demonstrate that the approach is effective for interactive data analysis, supporting enhanced understanding of clustering results as well as the interactive process itself.",

However, video analysis is typically a time-consuming process, where the analyst needs to memorize and annotate scenes. In contrast, visualization typically relies on an abstract data model, often using abstract visual mappings, and is not directly linked to the observed movement context anymore. We propose a visual analytics system that tightly integrates team sport video recordings with abstract visualization of underlying trajectory data. We apply appropriate computer vision techniques to extract trajectory data from video input. Furthermore, we apply advanced trajectory and movement analysis techniques to derive relevant team sport analytic measures for region, event and player analysis in the case of soccer analysis.
