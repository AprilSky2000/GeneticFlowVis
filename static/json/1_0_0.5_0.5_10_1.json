The technique, which we call Virtual Smoke, simulates the use of colored smoke for experimental gaseous fluid flow visualization. However, it is noninvasive and can animate, in particular, the dynamic behaviors of steady-state or instantaneous flow fields obtained from numerical simulations. Virtual Smoke is based on Volume Seeds and Volume Seedlings, which are direct volume visualization methods previously developed for highly interactive scalar volume data exploration. We use data from combustion simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of Virtual Smoke.",

This method allows a computational fluid dynamics user to visualize the basic physical process of dispersion and mixing rather than just the vector and scalar values computed by the simulation. It is based on transforming the vector field from a traditionally Eulerian reference frame into a Lagrangian reference frame. Fluid elements are traced through the vector field for the mean path as well as the statistical dispersion of the fluid elements about the mean position by using added scalar information about the root mean square value of the vector field and its Lagrangian time scale. In this way, clouds of fluid elements are traced not just mean paths. We have used this method to visualize the simulation of an industrial incinerator to help identify mechanisms for poor mixing. >",

There are special considerations for such design and implementation. It focuses on the PVR algorithm, and provides a thorough discussion on the library design of a parallel polygonrenderer. The chapter performs tests for runtime visualization of a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver, on the Intel Paragon XP/S using from 8 to 216 processors. Interactive visual responses reflecting simulation states and the physical phenomena modeled, allow better control of the simulation, and can offer additional insights into the physics behind the model. Performance studies show that the parallel rendering process is scalable with the size of the simulation as well as with the parallel computer. The chapter mentions that although the current implementation only handles data on a rectilinear grid, the design principles of the library can be generalized to handle unstructured or curvilinear grids as well.",

This complete rendering pipeline makes possible highly efficient rendering and remote viewing of high resolution time-varying data sets in the absence of high-speed network and parallel I/O support. To study the performance of this rendering pipeline and to demonstrate high-performance remote visualization, tests were conducted on a PC cluster in Japan as well as an SGI Origin 2000 operated at the NASA Ames Research Center with the display located at UC Davis.",

Using a single PC equipped with a modest amount of memory, a texture capable graphics card, and an inexpensive disk array, we are able to render hundreds of time steps of regularly gridded volume data (up to 45 millions voxels each time step) at interactive rates, permitting the visual exploration of large scientific data sets in both the temporal and spatial domain.",

Image graphs represent not only the results but also the process of data visualization. Each node in an image graph consists of an image and the corresponding visualization parameters used to produce it. Each edge in a graph shows the change in rendering parameters between the two nodes it connects. Image graphs are not just static representations: users can interact with a graph to review a previous visualization session or to perform new rendering. Operations which cause changes in rendering parameters can propagate through the graph. The user can take advantage of the information in image graphs to understand how certain parameter changes affect visualization results. Users can also share image graphs to streamline the process of collaborative visualization.

Through tabular organization and a clear correspondence between parameters and results, the interface eases the discovery, comparison and analysis of the underlying data.

A good visualization comes from experimenting with visualization, rendering, and viewing parameters to bring out the most relevant information in the data. A good data visualization system thus lets scientists interactively explore the parameter space intuitively. The more efficient the system, the fewer the number of iterations needed for parameter selection. Over the past 10 years, significant efforts have gone into advancing visualization technology (such as real-time volume rendering and immersive environments), but little into coherently representing the process and results (images and insights) of visualization. This information about the data exploration should be shared and reused. In particular, for types of data visualization with a high cost of producing images and less than obvious relationship between the rendering parameters and the image produced, a visual representation of the exploration process can make the process more efficient and effective. This visual representation of data exploration process and results can be incorporated into and become a part of the user interface of a data exploration system. That is, we need to go beyond the traditional graphical user interface (GUI) design by coupling it with a mechanism that helps users keep track of their visualization experience, use it to generate new visualizations, and share it with others. Doing so can reduce the cost of visualization, particularly for routine analysis of large-scale data sets.",

Conventional methods requires either an analytical description of the feature of interest or tedious manual intervention throughout the feature extraction and tracking process. We show that it is possible for a visualization system to learn to extract and track features in complex 4D flow field according to their visual properties, location, shape, and size. The basic approach is to employ machine learning in the process of visualization.

The goal of studying the cost of parallel rendering on a new class of supercomputers such as the Blue Gene/P is not necessarily to achieve real-time rendering rates. It is to identify and understand the extent of bottlenecks and interactions between various components that affect the design of future visualization solutions on these machines, solutions that may offer alternatives to hardware-accelerated volume rendering, for example, when large volumes, large image sizes, and very high quality results are dictated by peta- and exascale data. As a step in that direction, this study presents data from experiments under a number of conditions, including dataset size, number of processors, low- and high-quality rendering, offline storage of results, and streaming of images for remote display. Performance is divided into three main sections of the algorithm: disk I/O, rendering, and compositing. The dynamic balance among these tasks varies with the number of processors and other conditions. Lessons learned from the work include understanding the balance between parallel I/O, computation, and communication within the context of visualization on supercomputers; recommendations for tuning and optimization; and opportunities for further scaling.

This paper describes our study of a coherent solution based on quantization coupled with octree and difference encoding, and adaptive rendering for efficient visualization of timevarying volumetric data. Quantization is used to attain voxel-level compression and may have a significant influence on the performance of the subsequent encoding and visualization steps. Octree encoding is used for spatial domain compression, and difference encoding for temporal domain compression. In essence, neighboring voxels may be fused into macro voxels if they have similar values, and subtrees at consecutive time steps may be merged if they are identical. The software rendering process is tailored according to the tree structures and the volume visualization process. With the tree representation, selective rendering may be performed very efficiently. Additionally, the I/O costs are reduced. With these combined savings, a higher level of user interactivity is achieved. We have studied a variety of time-varying volume data sets, performed encoding based on data statistics, and optimized the rendering calculations wherever possible. Preliminary tests on workstations have shown in many cases tremendous reduction by as high as 90% in both storage space and inter-frame delay when compared to direct rendering of the raw data.",

In particular, the advances made in the field of visualization over the past 20 years have turned visualization from a presentation tool to a discovery tool. Machine learning has received great success in both data mining and computer graphics; surprisingly, the study of systematic ways to employ machine learning in making visualization is meager. Like human learning, we can make a computer program learn from previous input data to optimize its performance on processing new data. In the context of visualization, the use of machine learning can potentially free us from manually sifting through all the data. This paper describes intelligent visualization designs for three different applications: (1) volume classification and visualization, (2) 4D flow feature extraction and tracking, (3) network scan characterization.",

Because of the collaborative nature of the overall accelerator modeling project, the visualization technology developed is for both desktop and remote visualization settings. We have tested the techniques using both time-varying particle data sets containing up to one billion particles per time step and electromagnetic field data sets with millions of mesh elements.",

A characterization of the visualization process is discussed, leading to a general model of the visualization exploration process.

Significant visualization research has focused on the generation of visualizations (the depiction); less effort has focused on the exploratory aspects of visualization (the process). However, without formal models of the process, visualization exploration sessions cannot be fully utilized to assist users and system designers. Toward this end, we introduce the P-Set model of visualization exploration for describing this process and a framework to encapsulate, share, and analyze visual explorations. In addition, systems utilizing the model and framework are more efficient as redundant exploration is avoided. Several examples drawn from visualization applications demonstrate these benefits.

The centralized system acts as a portal into grid-enabled visualization systems. Scientists using the portal can focus on the important task of extracting insights from their data through visualization instead of having to worry about process management. Because scientists at LBNL and their collaborators require access to the portal from around the world, the portal's interface is entirely Web-based. Authenticated users only need a standards-compliant Web browser to explore their data from anywhere in the world. The portal provides a Web-based interface not just for exploring but also for encapsulating visualization data. Encapsulating the process lets users reproduce the visualization results for validation or extend those results by continuing data exploration. We discuss the integration of our grid-enabled visualization server, the visualization Web application that performs the visualization session management, and the Web-based interface.",

Our solution for visualizing such terascale simulations is based on a parallel adaptive rendering algorithm coupled with a new parallel I/O strategy which effectively reduces interframe delay by dedicating some processors to I/O and preprocessing tasks. In addition, a 2D vector field visualization method and a 3D enhancement technique are incorporated into the parallel visualization framework to help scientists better understand the wave propagation both on and under the ground surface. Our test results on the HP/Compaq AlphaServer operated at the PSC show that we can completely remove the I/O bottlenecks commonly present in time-varying data visualization. The high-performance visualization solution we provide to the scientists allows them to explore their data in the temporal, spatial, and variable domains at high resolution.

One class of this detailed data is consists of sets of different line types which should be visualized simultaneously to understand their relationships to one another. Examples include electric and magnetic field lines, velocity and vorticity field lines, or the trajectory paths of different particle types. The extreme size and high density of these datasets can overwhelm current visualization techniques by requiring too much memory, or too much compute time. Very dense lines can also result in unintelligible images where the depth relationships between the lines can not be conveyed with current methods. n To circumvent the pitfalls of current visualization technique with respect to difficult line-based data, the visualization techniques presented in this dissertation take into account perceptual issues. By providing the cues that the human visual system uses to resolve depth relationships, making use of the natural image processing capabilities of that system, and simulating real-world illumination, the visualization methods avoid ambiguity and present compelling images which are easily interpreted, and which reduce the likelihood of illusions. n Three visualization methods are presented, each with their own area of applicability. The first method efficiently combines two existing line rendering techniques, and is suitable for older machines with slower CPUs and graphics hardware with minimal texturing capabilities. The second method provides self-orienting geometry for texturing. It is appropriate for large datasets where the lines to be visualized project to be at least several pixels wide, and presents lines with the appearance of three dimensional tubes, but much more efficiently than using actual polygonal tubes, and with a greater degree of flexibility for taking full advantage of the sophisticated texturing capabilities of modern graphics hardware. The final visualization method is based on anisotropic volume rendering, and is appropriate for gigantic, very dense line datasets, where line thicknesses can range from one pixel to extremely sub-pixel. Together, these three methods cover a very broad range of dataset sizes, and are demonstrated for visualizing simulations of wake vortices around the tail of an airplane, electric and magnetic fields within a linear accelerator structures, and charged particle trajectories generated and influenced by those fields.",

Further, very dense or intertwined lines, rendered with traditional visualization techniques, can produce unintelligible results with unclear depth relationships between the lines and no sense of global structure. Our approach is to apply a lighting model to the lines and sample them into an anisotropic voxel representation based on spherical harmonics as a preprocessing step. Then we evaluate and render these voxels for a given view using traditional volume rendering. For extremely large line based datasets, conversion to anisotropic voxels reduces the overall storage and rendering for O(n) lines to O(1) with a large constant that is still small enough to allow meaningful visualization of the entire dataset at nearly interactive rates on a single commodity PC.",

When moving to parallel computation, not only does the code execution need to be considered but also communication between the different processes which can induce delays that are detrimental to performance. As the number of processes increases, so does the impact of the communication delays on performance. For large-scale parallel applications, it is critical to understand how the communication impacts performance in order to make the code more efficient. There are several tools available for visualizing program execution and communications on parallel systems. These tools generally provide either views which statistically summarize the entire program execution or process-centric views. However, process-centric visualizations do not scale well as the number of processes gets very large. In particular, the most common representation of parallel processes is a Gantt chart with a row for each process. As the number of processes increases, these charts can become difficult to work with and can even exceed screen resolution.

We introduce an intuitive user interface that allows the user to work in the cluster space, which shows the material classes with a set of material widgets, rather than work in the transfer function space.

Among various classification techniques, one very attractive and effective method is employing machine learning to classify the whole volume according to some minimum user input through an interactive brushing interface, where users paint directly on slices of the volume. For routine visualization tasks, we can thus reduce their cost if the visualization system can learn the tasks and apply the captured knowledge in future tasks. This paper presents an intelligent, interactive visualization system that supports FocusContext viewing of volume data. Features of interest should be the focal point of the visualization, and by applying appropriate rendering methods we are able to enhance these features and create more illustrative visualizations in a FocusContext style. We show with a set of case studies that it is possible to use machine learning to not only help classify volume but also better present the classified results.

The main strategy is to closely monitor and inspect network activities by collecting and analyzing data about the network traffic and the trails of system usage. The analysis usually requires large amounts of finely detailed, high-dimensional data to enable analysts to uncover hidden threats and make calculated predictions in a timely fashion. The traditional, signature-based and statistical methods are limited in their capability to cope with the large, evolving data and the dynamic nature of the Internet. Visualization proves effective to aid in understanding large, high-dimensional data commonly found in many demanding applications such as large-scale scientific simulations and biomedicine. There is thus a growing interest in the development of visualization methods as alternative or complementary solutions to the pressing cyber security problems (Brodley, Chan, Lippmann & Yurcik 2004, Ma, North & Yurcik 2005). The challenge is to develop new visual representations, layout methods, user interfaces, and interaction techniques that can effectively facilitate visual interrogation and communication of the vast amounts of cyber security information. Visual data analysis is inherently an iterative process, where each iteration provides more insight into the data being shown. A typical example of this process occurs with any type of overview plus detail visualization. Patterns in the overview tend to direct what the user chooses to view in more detail, and the detailed view can provide insight on regions of the overview. This drill-down process, starting at a high semantic level and progressing to more detailed views, creates a feedback loop as shown in Figure 1, which can lend itself well to visualizing the relationships between large number of objects, such as port and network scans. In most cases, different visual representations are needed for constructing these different views. In particular, each specific region of interest may be defined in a space of arbitrary dimensions. The challenge is thus to seek the best space and visual representation in that space for each type of analysis task. I show with three different tasks how visualization can assist in the analysis of computer network activities for detecting anomalies using the drill-down process.",

Transfer functions (TF) based on boundaries (insets on the left: top, 1D TF with gradient modulation, bottom, 2D TF of intensity vs. gradient magnitude) cannot separate the tumor from the vessels (where gradients are also strong). A transfer function based on occlusion separates the tumor from the vessels and the ventricular structures from skull and skin. Right: CT dataset with contrast agent. Classification is difficult due to overlap between bone and vessel structures (see red color in ribcage in the insets). An occlusion-based TF properly classifies bone and also highlights internal structures (blue). Abstractxe2x80x94Despite the ever-growing improvements on graphics processing units and computational power, classifying 3D volume data remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a new method for classifying volume data based on the ambient occlusion of voxels. This information stems from the observation that most volumes of a certain type, e.g., CT, MRI or flow simulation, contain occlusion patterns that reveal the spatial structure of their materials or features. Furthermore, these patterns appear to emerge consistently for different data sets of the same type. We call this collection of patterns the occlusion spectrum of a dataset. We show that using this occlusion spectrum leads to better two-dimensional transfer functions that can help classify complex data sets in terms of the spatial relationships among features. In general, the ambient occlusion of a voxel can be interpreted as a weighted average of the intensities in a spherical neighborhood around the voxel. Different weighting schemes determine the ability to separate structures of interest in the occlusion spectrum. We present a general methodology for finding such a weighting. We show results of our approach in 3D imaging for different applications, including brain and breast tumor detection and the visualization of turbulent flow.",

Then we decompose the streamlines into different groups based on a categorization of vector information, wherein the streamline pattern in each group is ensured to be coherent or nearly coherent.

We present a new approach to the volume classification problem which couples machine learning and a painting metaphor to allow more sophisticated classification in an intuitive manner. The user works in the volume data space by directly painting on sample slices of the volume and the painted voxels are used in an iterative training process. The trained system can then classify the entire volume. Both classification and rendering can be hardware accelerated, providing immediate visual feedback as painting progresses. Such an intelligent system approach enables the user to perform classification in a much higher dimensional space without explicitly specifying the mapping for every dimension used.

To maximize the utilization of the vast amount of data generated by these simulations, scientists also need scalable solutions for studying their data to different extents and at different abstraction levels. As we move into peta- and exa-scale computing, simply dumping as much raw simulation data as the storage capacity allows for post-processing analysis and visualization is no longer a viable approach. A common practice is to use a separate parallel computer to prepare data for subsequent analysis and visualization. A naive realization of this strategy not only limits the amount of data that can be saved, but also turns I/O into a performance bottleneck when using a large parallel system. We conjecture that the most plausible solution for the peta- and exa-scale data problem is to reduce or transform the data in-situ as it is being generated, so the amount of data that must be transferred over the network is kept to a minimum.

Since the data range may vary dramatically as the simulation progresses, volume rendering using local transfer functions may not be coherent for all time steps. We present an exploratory technique that enables coherent classification of time-varying volume data. Unlike previous approaches, which require pre-processing of all time steps, our approach lets the user explore the transfer function space without accessing the original 3D data. This is useful for interactive visualization, and absolutely essential for in-situ visualization, where the entire simulation data range is not known in advance. Our approach generates a compact representation of each time step at rendering time in the form of ray attenuation functions, which are used for subsequent operations on the opacity and color mappings.

We achieve this with the use of scale fields, which are 3D fields that represent the relative size of the local feature at each voxel. We present a mechanism for obtaining these scale fields at interactive rates, through a continuous scale-space analysis and a set of detection filters.

This information stems from the observation that most volumes of a certain type, e.g., CT, MRI or flow simulation, contain occlusion patterns that reveal the spatial structure of their materials or features. Furthermore, these patterns appear to emerge consistently for different data sets of the same type. We call this collection of patterns the occlusion spectrum of a dataset. We show that using this occlusion spectrum leads to better two-dimensional transfer functions that can help classify complex data sets in terms of the spatial relationships among features. In general, the ambient occlusion of a voxel can be interpreted as a weighted average of the intensities in a spherical neighborhood around the voxel. Different weighting schemes determine the ability to separate structures of interest in the occlusion spectrum. We present a general methodology for finding such a weighting. We show results of our approach in 3D imaging for different applications, including brain and breast tumor detection and the visualization of turbulent flow.",

In this paper, we explore the 1D and 2D transfer functions that result from intensity values and gradient magnitude. With the help of these histograms, users can manage a complex set of transfer function parameters that maximize the visibility of the intervals of interest and provide high quality images of volume data. We present a semiautomated method for generating transfer functions, which progressively explores the transfer function space toward the goal of maximizing visibility of important structures.

When making decisions based on uncertain data, it is important to quantify and present to the analyst both the aggregated uncertainty of the results and the impact of the sources of that uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new framework to support uncertainty in the visual analytics process, through statistic methods such as uncertainty modeling, propagation and aggregation.

This approach is limited in providing the optimal in-between views of the data. Alternatively, computer graphics and virtual reality camera motion planning is frequently focused on collision free movement in a virtual walkthrough. For semi-transparent, fuzzy, or blobby volume data the collision free objective becomes insufficient. Here, we provide a set of essential criteria focused on computing camera paths to establish effective animations of volume data. Our dynamic multi-criteria solver coupled with a force-directed routing algorithm enables rapid generation of camera paths. Once users review the resulting animation and evaluate the camera motion, they are able to determine how each criterion impacts path generation. In this paper, we demonstrate how incorporating this animation approach with an interactive volume visualization system reduces the effort in creating context-aware and coherent animations.

With volume ray casting, per-ray visibility histograms summarize the contribution of samples along each ray to the final image. By quantifying visibility for the region of interest, indicated by the PET data, occluding tissues can be made just transparent enough to give a clear view of the features in that region while preserving some context. Unlike most previous methods relying on costly-preprocessing and tedious manual tuning, our technique achieves comparable and better results based on on-the-fly processing that still enables interactive visualization.

Most feature extraction and tracking methods first identify features of interest in each time step independently, then correspond these features in consecutive time steps of the data. Since these methods handle each time step separately, they do not use the coherency of the feature along the time dimension in the extraction process. In this paper, we present a prediction-correction method that uses a prediction step to make the best guess of the feature region in the subsequent time step, followed by growing and shrinking the border of the predicted region to coherently extract the actual feature of interest. This method makes use of the temporal-space coherency of the data to accelerate the extraction process while implicitly solving the tedious correspondence problem that previous methods focus on.

The processing power of massively parallel supercomputers increases at a rather fast rate, about an order of magnitude faster every three years, enabling scientists to model complex physical phenomena and chemical processes at unprecedented fidelity. Several petascale computers are already in operation (http://www.top500.org) and exascale computing is around the corner. Each run of a petascale simulation typically outputs several hundred terabytes of data to disk. Transferring data at this scale over wide-area networks to the scientist's laboratory for post-processing analysis is not an option. Even the data files may be transferred, existing desktop data analysis and visualization tools cannot effectively handle such large-scale data. If the scientists may use the same supercomputing facility for data analysis and visualization, there are three viable solutions: xe2x80xa2 in situ visualization, where visualization is computed during the simulation on the same supercomputer, xe2x80xa2 co-processing visualization, where visualization is computed during the simulation on a separate computer, and xe2x80xa2 post-processing visualization, where visualization is computed after simulation is over.",

One challenge is to find and classify the representative field lines. Most existing solutions follow an automatic approach that generates field lines characterizing the flow and arranges these lines into a single picture. In our work, we advocate a user-centric approach to exploring 3D vector fields. Our method allows the user to sketch 2D curves for pattern matching in 2D and field lines clustering in 3D. Specifically, a 3D field line whose view-dependent 2D projection is most similar to the user drawing will be identified and utilized to extract all similar 3D field lines. Furthermore, we employ an automatic clustering method to generate field-line templates for the user to locate subfields of interest. This semi-automatic process leverages the user's knowledge about the flow field through intuitive user interaction, resulting in a promising alternative to existing flow visualization solutions. With our sketch-based interface, the user can effectively dissect the flow field and make more structured visualization for analysis or presentation.",

The effectiveness of such a visual validation and analysis process mainly relies on a good strategy to categorize and visualize the lines. However, the sheer size of line data produced by state-of-the-art scientific simulations poses great challenges to preparing the data for visualization. In this paper, we present a parallelization design of regression model-based clustering to categorize large line data derived from detailed scientific simulations by leveraging the power of heterogeneous computers. This parallel clustering method employs the Expectation Maximization algorithm to iteratively approximate the optimal data partitioning. First, we use a sorted-balance algorithm to partition and distribute the lines with various lengths among multiple compute nodes. During the following iterative clustering process, regression model parameters are recovered based on the local lines on each individual node, with only a few inter-node message exchanges involved. Meanwhile, the workload of regression model computing is well balanced across the nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively categorize large line data in a scalable manner to concisely convey dynamic structures and interactions, leading to a visualization that captures salient features and suppresses visual clutter to facilitate scientific exploration of large line data.",

We provide a case study on the magnitude scale M w 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, which is the most thoroughly recorded earthquake event ever in the history. More than 400 stations recorded this event, and the readings from this event increased global strong-motion records five folds. Each station measured east-west, north-south, and vertical component of acceleration for approximately 90 seconds. The sensor network released the initial raw data within minutes after the Chi-Chi mainshock. It is essential to have a visualization system for fast data exploring and analyzing, offering crucial visual analytical information for scientists to make quick judgments. Raw data requires preprocessing before it can be rendered. We generated a sequence of ground-motion wave-field maps of 350 xc3x97 200 regular grid covers the entire Taiwan island from the sensor network readings.

We achieve this by automatically extracting layers depicted in composited images. The layers can then be recombined in different ways to simulate opacity changes and recoloring of individual features. Our results demonstrate that explorable images are especially useful when the volume data is too large for interactive exploration, takes too long to render due to the underlying mesh structure or desired shading effect, or if the original volume data is not available. Explorable images can offer real-time image-based interaction as a preview mechanism for remote visualization or visualization of large volume data on low-end hardware, within a mobile device, or a Web browser.",

Data exploration using directvolume rendering requires multiple (often redundant) accesses to possibly large amounts of data.

            "abstract": "Successful in-situ and remote visualization solutions must have minimal storage requirements and account for only a small percentage of supercomputing time. One solution that meets these requirements is to store a compact intermediate representation of the data, instead of a 3D volume itself. Recent work explores the use of attenuation functions as a data representation that summarizes the distribution of attenuation along the rays. This representation goes beyond conventional static images and allows users to dynamically explore their data, for example, to change color and opacity parameters, without accessing the original 3D data. The computation and storage costs of this method may still be prohibitively expensive for large and time-varying data sets, thus limiting its applicability in the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for computing attenuation functions in parallel. We exploit the fact that the distribution of attenuation can be constructed recursively from a hierarchy of blocks or intervals of the data, which is a highly parallelizeable process. We have developed a library of routines that can be used in a distance visualization scenario or can be called directly from a simulation code to generate explorable images in-situ. Through a number of examples, we demonstrate the application of this work to large-scale scientific simulations in a real-world parallel environment with thousands of processors. We also explore various compression methods for reducing the size of the RAF. Finally, we present a method for computing an alternative RAF representation, which more closely encodes the actual distribution of samples along a ray, using kernel density estimation.",

Gradient estimation is necessary for rendering shaded isosurfaces and specular highlights, which provide important cues for shape and depth. Gradient estimation has been widely studied and deployed for regular-grid volume data to achieve local illumination effects, but has been, otherwise, for unstructured-mesh data. As a result, most of the unstructured-mesh volume visualizations made so far were unlit. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of gradient estimation methods for unstructured meshes with respect to their cost and performance. Through a number of benchmarks, we discuss the effects of mesh quality and scalar function complexity in the accuracy of the reconstruction, and their impact in lighting-enabled volume rendering. Based on our study, we also propose two heuristic improvements to the gradient reconstruction process. The first heuristic improves the rendering quality with a hybrid algorithm that combines the results of the multiple reconstruction methods, based on the properties of a given mesh. The second heuristic improves the efficiency of its GPU implementation, by restricting the computation of the gradient on a fixed-size local neighborhood.",

The system has a three-level memory hierarchy: GPU memory, main memory, and a solid state drive (SSD).

The basis of the design is a partial differential equation based illumination model to simulate the light propagation, absorption, and scattering within the volumetric medium. In particular, a two-level scheme is introduced to overcome the challenges presented by unstructured grids. Test results show that the added illumination effects such as global shadowing and multiple scattering not only lead to more visually pleasing visualization, but also greatly enhance the perception of the depth information and complex spatial relationships for features of interest in the volume data. This volume visualization enhancement is introduced at a time when unstructured grids are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of scientific simulation applications.",

All users, regardless of their domain knowledge, first must learn how to interpret the visually encoded information in order to infer knowledge from visualizations. Yet, despite its significance, there has been little research on how to design effective introductory materials for information visualization. This paper presents a study on the design of online guides that educate new users on how to utilize information visualizations, particularly focusing on the employment of exercise questions in the guides. We use two concepts from educational psychology, learning type (or learning style) and teaching method, to design four unique types of online guides. The effects of the guides are measured by comprehension tests of a large group of crowdsourced participants. The tests covered four visualization types (graph, scatter plot, storyline, and tree map) and a complete range of visual analytics tasks. Our statistical analyses indicate that online guides which employ active learning and the top-down teaching method are the most effective. Our study provides quantitative insight into the use of exercise questions in online guides for information visualizations and will inspire further research on design considerations for other elements in introductory materials.",

However, designing interactive visualizations for informal learning environments, such as museums, presents several challenges. First, visualizations must engage visitors on a personal level. Second, visitors often lack the background to interpret visualizations of scientific data. Third, visitors have very limited time at individual exhibits in museums. This paper examines these design considerations through the iterative development and evaluation of an interactive exhibit as a visualization tool that gives museumgoers access to scientific data generated and used by researchers. The exhibit prototype, Living Liquid, encourages visitors to ask and answer their own questions while exploring the time-varying global distribution of simulated marine microbes using a touchscreen interface. Iterative development proceeded through three rounds of formative evaluations using think-aloud protocols and interviews, each round informing a key visualization design decision: (1) what to visualize to initiate inquiry, (2) how to link data at the microscopic scale to global patterns, and (3) how to include additional data that allows visitors to pursue their own questions. Data from visitor evaluations suggests that, when designing visualizations for public audiences, one should (1) avoid distracting visitors from data that they should explore, (2) incorporate background information into the visualization, (3) favor understandability over scientific accuracy, and (4) layer data accessibility to structure inquiry. Lessons learned from this case study add to our growing understanding of how to use visualizations to actively engage learners with scientific data.",

This dynamic characteristic along with other features of uncertainty pose a great challenge to effective uncertainty-aware visualization. This paper presents a new framework for modeling uncertainty and characterizing the evolution of the uncertainty information through analytical processes. Based on the framework, we have designed a visual metaphor called uncertainty flow to visually and intuitively summarize how uncertainty information propagates over the whole analysis pipeline. Our system allows analysts to interact with and analyze the uncertainty information at different levels of detail. Three experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and intuitiveness of our design.",

Our method models light propagation, including both absorption and scattering, in a volume using a convection-diffusion equation that can be solved numerically. The main advantage of such technique is that the light modeling and simulation can be separated, where we can use a unified partial-differential equation to model various illumination effects, and adopt highly-parallelized grid-based numerical schemes to solve it. Results show that our method can achieve high quality volume illumination with dynamic color and opacity mapping and various light sources in real-time.

In this paper, we present a new design concept, engagement-versatile design, for visualizations that target users with a variety of engagement styles. Without losing generality, we demonstrate the feasibility of this concept through the designing of a system called Stock Lamp, an engagement-versatile visualization that helps users keep track of the stock market in real-time. This design process includes identifying different modes of engagement, deriving design implications from each engagement-mode, and applying them to the visualization's design. Our user study shows that Stock Lamp is able to consistently relay market information even when the users are multi-tasking. We believe this study establishes a new concept that promotes a systematic design approach that leverages both theoretical and empirical design methodologies for future visualization development.",

We focus on event sequence data due to its vulnerability to privacy concerns. Our visual interface is designed for data owners to examine potential privacy issues, obfuscate information as suggested by the algorithm, and fine-tune the results per their requests.

With additional ontology information, the semantics behind the network structure can be further explored. Unfortunately, creating network visualizations with these datasets for presentation can inadvertently expose the private and sensitive information of individuals that reside in the data. To deal with this problem, we generalize conventional data anonymization models (originally designed for relational data) and formally apply them in the context of privacy preserving ontological network visualization. We use these models to identify the privacy leaks that exist in a visualization, provide graph modification actions that remove and/or perceptually minimize the effect of the identified leaks, and discuss strategies for what types of privacy actions to choose depending on the context of the leaks. We implement an ontological visualization interface with associated privacy preserving operations, and demonstrate with two case studies using real-world datasets to show that our approach can identify and solve potential privacy issues while balancing overall graph readability and utility.",

Unfortunately, such visualizations can inadvertently expose the ostensibly private identities of the persons that make up the dataset. By purposely violating graph readability metrics for a small region of the graph, we conjecture that local, exposed privacy leaks may be perceptually masked from easy recognition. In particular, we consider three commonly known metricsxe2x80x94edge crossing, node clustering, and node-edge overlappingxe2x80x94as a strategy to hide leaks. We evaluate the effectiveness of violating these metrics by conducting a user study that measures subject performance at visually searching for and identifying a privacy leak. Results show that when more masking operations are applied, participants needed more time to locate the privacy leak, though exhaustive, brute force search can eventually find it. We suggest future directions on how perceptual masking can be a viable strategy, primarily where modifying the underlying network structure is unfeasible.",

Selecting a xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users.",

In practice, users often visualize a graph in multiple layouts by using different methods and varying parameter settings until they find a layout that best suits the purpose of the visualization. However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined heuristics.",

In addition, the problem becomes even more challenging when the dynamic data records have a varying number of dimensions as often found in real-world applications. This paper presents an incremental DR solution. We enhance an existing incremental PCA method in several ways to ensure its usability for visualizing streaming multidimensional data. First, we use geometric transformation and animation methods to help preserve a viewer's mental map when visualizing the incremental results. Second, to handle data dimension variants, we use an optimization method to estimate the projected data positions, and also convey the resulting uncertainty in the visualization.

However, to interpret the DR result for gaining useful insights from the data, it would take additional analysis effort such as identifying clusters and understanding their characteristics. While there are many automatic methods (e.g., density-based clustering methods) to identify clusters, effective methods for understanding a cluster's characteristics are still lacking. A cluster can be mostly characterized by its distribution of feature values. Reviewing the original feature values is not a straightforward task when the number of features is large. To address this challenge, we present a visual analytics method that effectively highlights the essential features of a cluster in a DR result. To extract the essential features, we introduce an enhanced usage of contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA). Our method, called ccPCA (contrasting clusters in PCA), can calculate each feature's relative contribution to the contrast between one cluster and other clusters. With ccPCA, we have created an interactive system including a scalable visualization of clusters' feature contributions.
