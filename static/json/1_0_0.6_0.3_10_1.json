The technique, which we call Virtual Smoke, simulates the use of colored smoke for experimental gaseous fluid flow visualization. However, it is noninvasive and can animate, in particular, the dynamic behaviors of steady-state or instantaneous flow fields obtained from numerical simulations. Virtual Smoke is based on Volume Seeds and Volume Seedlings, which are direct volume visualization methods previously developed for highly interactive scalar volume data exploration. We use data from combustion simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of Virtual Smoke.",

We survey previous research results in parallel volume rendering as well as commercial products that take advantage of parallel processing to make volume rendering a practical visualization method. Our focus is on developing distributed computation methods that can distribute the memory and computational demands of volume visualization across a network of general purpose workstations. We describe three distributed computation strategies based on ray-casting volume rendering that can be implemented on either shared-memory multiprocessor workstations or on a network of ordinary workstations. Multiple views of real-time feature extraction give tremendous insight to the volume data. Multiple variable visualization helps scientists to capture the interaction between important variables in a simulation. Divide-and-conquer rendering allows interactive high-resolution volume visualization of large data sets on a network of midrange workstations, even when the data set is too large for available memory on any single workstation. Several examples in medical imaging and computational fluid dynamics are shown illustrating the practicality of these methods.",

This method allows a computational fluid dynamics user to visualize the basic physical process of dispersion and mixing rather than just the vector and scalar values computed by the simulation. It is based on transforming the vector field from a traditionally Eulerian reference frame into a Lagrangian reference frame. Fluid elements are traced through the vector field for the mean path as well as the statistical dispersion of the fluid elements about the mean position by using added scalar information about the root mean square value of the vector field and its Lagrangian time scale. In this way, clouds of fluid elements are traced not just mean paths. We have used this method to visualize the simulation of an industrial incinerator to help identify mechanisms for poor mixing. >",

In this paper, we present a novel visualization framework that combines the advantages of clustering methods and illustrative rendering techniques to generate a concise and informative depiction of complex flow structures. Given a 3D vector field, we first generate a number of streamlines covering the important regions based on an entropy measurement. Then we decompose the streamlines into different groups based on a categorization of vector information, wherein the streamline pattern in each group is ensured to be coherent or nearly coherent. For each group, we select a set of representative streamlines and render them in an illustrative fashion to enhance depth cues and succinctly show local flow characteristics. The results demonstrate that our approach can generate a visualization that is relatively free of visual clutter while facilitating perception of salient information of complex vector fields.",

There are special considerations for such design and implementation. It focuses on the PVR algorithm, and provides a thorough discussion on the library design of a parallel polygonrenderer. The chapter performs tests for runtime visualization of a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver, on the Intel Paragon XP/S using from 8 to 216 processors. Interactive visual responses reflecting simulation states and the physical phenomena modeled, allow better control of the simulation, and can offer additional insights into the physics behind the model. Performance studies show that the parallel rendering process is scalable with the size of the simulation as well as with the parallel computer. The chapter mentions that although the current implementation only handles data on a rectilinear grid, the design principles of the library can be generalized to handle unstructured or curvilinear grids as well.",

To maximize the utilization of the vast amount of data generated by these simulations, scientists also need scalable solutions for studying their data to different extents and at different abstraction levels. As we move into peta- and exa-scale computing, simply dumping as much raw simulation data as the storage capacity allows for post-processing analysis and visualization is no longer a viable approach. A common practice is to use a separate parallel computer to prepare data for subsequent analysis and visualization. A naive realization of this strategy not only limits the amount of data that can be saved, but also turns I/O into a performance bottleneck when using a large parallel system. We conjecture that the most plausible solution for the peta- and exa-scale data problem is to reduce or transform the data in-situ as it is being generated, so the amount of data that must be transferred over the network is kept to a minimum. In this paper, we discuss different approaches to in-situ processing and visualization as well as the results of our preliminary study using large-scale simulation codes on massively parallel supercomputers.",

The goal of studying the cost of parallel rendering on a new class of supercomputers such as the Blue Gene/P is not necessarily to achieve real-time rendering rates. It is to identify and understand the extent of bottlenecks and interactions between various components that affect the design of future visualization solutions on these machines, solutions that may offer alternatives to hardware-accelerated volume rendering, for example, when large volumes, large image sizes, and very high quality results are dictated by peta- and exascale data. As a step in that direction, this study presents data from experiments under a number of conditions, including dataset size, number of processors, low- and high-quality rendering, offline storage of results, and streaming of images for remote display. Performance is divided into three main sections of the algorithm: disk I/O, rendering, and compositing. The dynamic balance among these tasks varies with the number of processors and other conditions. Lessons learned from the work include understanding the balance between parallel I/O, computation, and communication within the context of visualization on supercomputers; recommendations for tuning and optimization; and opportunities for further scaling. Extrapolating these results to very large data and image sizes suggests that a distributed-memory high-performance computing architecture such as the Blue Gene is a viable platform for some types of visualization at very large scales.",

Over the past 10 years, significant efforts have gone into advancing visualization technology (such as real-time volume rendering and immersive environments), but little into coherently representing the process and results (images and insights) of visualization. This information about the data exploration should be shared and reused. In particular, for types of data visualization with a high cost of producing images and less than obvious relationship between the rendering parameters and the image produced, a visual representation of the exploration process can make the process more efficient and effective. This visual representation of data exploration process and results can be incorporated into and become a part of the user interface of a data exploration system.

In addition, systems utilizing the model and framework are more efficient as redundant exploration is avoided. Several examples drawn from visualization applications demonstrate these benefits. Taken together, the model and framework provide an effective means to exploit the information within the visual exploration process",

Conventional methods requires either an analytical description of the feature of interest or tedious manual intervention throughout the feature extraction and tracking process. We show that it is possible for a visualization system to learn to extract and track features in complex 4D flow field according to their visual properties, location, shape, and size. The basic approach is to employ machine learning in the process of visualization. Such an intelligent system approach is powerful because it allows us to extract and track an feature of interest in a high-dimensional space without explicitly specifying the relations between those dimensions, resulting in a greatly simplified and intuitive visualization interface.",

This paper describes our study of a coherent solution based on quantization coupled with octree and difference encoding, and adaptive rendering for efficient visualization of timevarying volumetric data. Quantization is used to attain voxel-level compression and may have a significant influence on the performance of the subsequent encoding and visualization steps. Octree encoding is used for spatial domain compression, and difference encoding for temporal domain compression. In essence, neighboring voxels may be fused into macro voxels if they have similar values, and subtrees at consecutive time steps may be merged if they are identical. The software rendering process is tailored according to the tree structures and the volume visualization process. With the tree representation, selective rendering may be performed very efficiently. Additionally, the I/O costs are reduced. With these combined savings, a higher level of user interactivity is achieved. We have studied a variety of time-varying volume data sets, performed encoding based on data statistics, and optimized the rendering calculations wherever possible. Preliminary tests on workstations have shown in many cases tremendous reduction by as high as 90% in both storage space and inter-frame delay when compared to direct rendering of the raw data.",

Because of the collaborative nature of the overall accelerator modeling project, the visualization technology developed is for both desktop and remote visualization settings.

The method uses particle systems, with rules such that particles flow over the surface of an object to not only bring out, but also attract attention to information on a shape that might not be readily visible with a conventional rendering method which uses lighting and view changes. Replacing still images with animations in this fashion, we demonstrate with both surface and volumetric models in the accompanying videos that, in many cases, the resulting visualizations effectively enhance the perception of three-dimensional shape and structure. We also describe how, for both types of data, a texture-based representation of this motion can be used for interactive visualization using PC graphics hardware.

Direct volume rendering is used to depict the space-time relationships of seismic readings collected from sensor stations in an intuitive way such that the progress of seismic wave propagation of an earthquake event can be directly observed. The resulting visualization reveals the sequence of seismic wave initiation, propagation, attenuation over time, and energy releasing events. We provide a case study on the magnitude scale M w 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, which is the most thoroughly recorded earthquake event ever in the history. More than 400 stations recorded this event, and the readings from this event increased global strong-motion records five folds. Each station measured east-west, north-south, and vertical component of acceleration for approximately 90 seconds. The sensor network released the initial raw data within minutes after the Chi-Chi mainshock. It is essential to have a visualization system for fast data exploring and analyzing, offering crucial visual analytical information for scientists to make quick judgments. Raw data requires preprocessing before it can be rendered. We generated a sequence of ground-motion wave-field maps of 350 xc3x97 200 regular grid covers the entire Taiwan island from the sensor network readings. The result is a total of 1000 ground-motion wave-field maps with 0.1 second interval, forming a 1000 xc3x97 350 xc3x97 200 volume data set. We show that visualizing the time-varying component of the data spatially uncovers the changing features hidden in the data.",

This is especially challenging when the global data range is not known in advance, as is often the case in remote and in-situ visualization settings. Since the data range may vary dramatically as the simulation progresses, volume rendering using local transfer functions may not be coherent for all time steps. We present an exploratory technique that enables coherent classification of time-varying volume data. Unlike previous approaches, which require pre-processing of all time steps, our approach lets the user explore the transfer function space without accessing the original 3D data. This is useful for interactive visualization, and absolutely essential for in-situ visualization, where the entire simulation data range is not known in advance. Our approach generates a compact representation of each time step at rendering time in the form of ray attenuation functions, which are used for subsequent operations on the opacity and color mappings. The presented approach offers interactive exploration of time-varying simulation data that alleviates the cost associated with reloading and caching large data sets.",

Features of interest should be the focal point of the visualization, and by applying appropriate rendering methods we are able to enhance these features and create more illustrative visualizations in a FocusContext style. We show with a set of case studies that it is possible to use machine learning to not only help classify volume but also better present the classified results. This new capability makes visualization a more usable tool.",

Replacing still images with animations in this fashion, we demonstrate with both surface and volumetric models in the accompanying videos that in many cases the resulting visualizations effectively enhance the perception of three-dimensional shape and structure.

This representation also allows us to obtain pathlines through streamline tracing in the 4D space.

Based on this hierarchical representation, a data partitioning scheme is designed to achieve high parallel efficiency.

Direct volume rendering is used to depict the space-time relationships of numerical results and seismic readings.

            "abstract": "Networked computers are subject to attack, misuse, and abuse. Organizations and individuals are making every effort to build and maintain trustworthy computing systems. The main strategy is to closely monitor and inspect network activities by collecting and analyzing data about the network traffic and the trails of system usage. The analysis usually requires large amounts of finely detailed, high-dimensional data to enable analysts to uncover hidden threats and make calculated predictions in a timely fashion. The traditional, signature-based and statistical methods are limited in their capability to cope with the large, evolving data and the dynamic nature of the Internet. Visualization proves effective to aid in understanding large, high-dimensional data commonly found in many demanding applications such as large-scale scientific simulations and biomedicine. There is thus a growing interest in the development of visualization methods as alternative or complementary solutions to the pressing cyber security problems (Brodley, Chan, Lippmann & Yurcik 2004, Ma, North & Yurcik 2005). The challenge is to develop new visual representations, layout methods, user interfaces, and interaction techniques that can effectively facilitate visual interrogation and communication of the vast amounts of cyber security information. Visual data analysis is inherently an iterative process, where each iteration provides more insight into the data being shown. A typical example of this process occurs with any type of overview plus detail visualization. Patterns in the overview tend to direct what the user chooses to view in more detail, and the detailed view can provide insight on regions of the overview. This drill-down process, starting at a high semantic level and progressing to more detailed views, creates a feedback loop as shown in Figure 1, which can lend itself well to visualizing the relationships between large number of objects, such as port and network scans. In most cases, different visual representations are needed for constructing these different views. In particular, each specific region of interest may be defined in a space of arbitrary dimensions. The challenge is thus to seek the best space and visual representation in that space for each type of analysis task. I show with three different tasks how visualization can assist in the analysis of computer network activities for detecting anomalies using the drill-down process.",

One class of this detailed data is consists of sets of different line types which should be visualized simultaneously to understand their relationships to one another. Examples include electric and magnetic field lines, velocity and vorticity field lines, or the trajectory paths of different particle types. The extreme size and high density of these datasets can overwhelm current visualization techniques by requiring too much memory, or too much compute time. Very dense lines can also result in unintelligible images where the depth relationships between the lines can not be conveyed with current methods. n To circumvent the pitfalls of current visualization technique with respect to difficult line-based data, the visualization techniques presented in this dissertation take into account perceptual issues. By providing the cues that the human visual system uses to resolve depth relationships, making use of the natural image processing capabilities of that system, and simulating real-world illumination, the visualization methods avoid ambiguity and present compelling images which are easily interpreted, and which reduce the likelihood of illusions. n Three visualization methods are presented, each with their own area of applicability. The first method efficiently combines two existing line rendering techniques, and is suitable for older machines with slower CPUs and graphics hardware with minimal texturing capabilities. The second method provides self-orienting geometry for texturing. It is appropriate for large datasets where the lines to be visualized project to be at least several pixels wide, and presents lines with the appearance of three dimensional tubes, but much more efficiently than using actual polygonal tubes, and with a greater degree of flexibility for taking full advantage of the sophisticated texturing capabilities of modern graphics hardware. The final visualization method is based on anisotropic volume rendering, and is appropriate for gigantic, very dense line datasets, where line thicknesses can range from one pixel to extremely sub-pixel. Together, these three methods cover a very broad range of dataset sizes, and are demonstrated for visualizing simulations of wake vortices around the tail of an airplane, electric and magnetic fields within a linear accelerator structures, and charged particle trajectories generated and influenced by those fields.",

While these vector data such as electromagnetic fields, fluid flow fields, or particle paths can be represented by lines, the sheer number of the lines overwhelms the memory and computation capability of a high-end PC used for visualization. Further, very dense or intertwined lines, rendered with traditional visualization techniques, can produce unintelligible results with unclear depth relationships between the lines and no sense of global structure. Our approach is to apply a lighting model to the lines and sample them into an anisotropic voxel representation based on spherical harmonics as a preprocessing step. Then we evaluate and render these voxels for a given view using traditional volume rendering. For extremely large line based datasets, conversion to anisotropic voxels reduces the overall storage and rendering for O(n) lines to O(1) with a large constant that is still small enough to allow meaningful visualization of the entire dataset at nearly interactive rates on a single commodity PC.",

            "abstract": "In serial computation, program profiling is often helpful for optimization of key sections of code. When moving to parallel computation, not only does the code execution need to be considered but also communication between the different processes which can induce delays that are detrimental to performance. As the number of processes increases, so does the impact of the communication delays on performance. For large-scale parallel applications, it is critical to understand how the communication impacts performance in order to make the code more efficient. There are several tools available for visualizing program execution and communications on parallel systems. These tools generally provide either views which statistically summarize the entire program execution or process-centric views. However, process-centric visualizations do not scale well as the number of processes gets very large. In particular, the most common representation of parallel processes is a Gantt chart with a row for each process. As the number of processes increases, these charts can become difficult to work with and can even exceed screen resolution. We propose a new visualization approach that affords more scalability and then demonstrate it on systems running with up to 16,384 processes.",

We introduce an intuitive user interface that allows the user to work in the cluster space, which shows the material classes with a set of material widgets, rather than work in the transfer function space. This interface not only provides the user the capability to specify arbitrary-dimensional transfer functions, but also allows the user to operate directly on the classification and visualization results.",

We achieve this with the use of scale fields, which are 3D fields that represent the relative size of the local feature at each voxel. We present a mechanism for obtaining these scale fields at interactive rates, through a continuous scale-space analysis and a set of detection filters. Through a number of examples, we show that size-based transfer functions can improve classification and enhance volume rendering techniques, such as maximum intensity projection.

However, in the process of generating 2D images from 3D data, information is lost in the form of attenuation and occlusion. The lack of a feedback mechanism to quantify the loss of information in the rendering process makes the design of good transfer functions a difficult and time consuming task. In this paper, we present the notion of visibility-driven transfer functions, which are transfer functions that provide a good visibility of features of interest from a given viewpoint. To achieve this, we introduce visibility histograms. These histograms provide graphical cues that intuitively inform the user about the contribution of particular scalar values to the final image. By carefully manipulating the parameters of the opacity transfer function, users can now maximize the visibility of the intervals of interest in a volume data set. Based on this observation, we also propose a semi-automated method for generating transfer functions, which progressively improves a transfer function defined by the user, according to a certain importance metric. Now the user does not have to deal with the tedious task of making small changes to the transfer function parameters, but now he/she can rely on the system to perform these searches automatically. Our methodology can be easily deployed in most visualization systems and can be used together with traditional 1D opacity transfer functions based on scalar values, as well as with multidimensional transfer functions and other more sophisticated rendering algorithms.",

However these generally utilize a text based interface, and they do not take into account the content of the music itself. As such, they do not handle untagged or mistagged music well. Automated metrics exist, but are not as widely used since they have the potential to be unreliable. This paper presents a graph-based visual interface for exploring a library of music based on analysis of the content of the music rather than tag information, which allows the user to navigate a music library thematically.",

In ongoing research into testing parallel volume rendering on the IBM Blue Gene/P (BG/P), we measure performance of disk I/O, rendering, and compositing on large datasets, and evaluate bottlenecks with respect to system-specific I/O and communication patterns. To extend the scalability of the direct-send image compositing stage of the volume rendering algorithm, we limit the number of compositing cores when many small messages are exchanged. To improve the data-loading stage of the volume renderer, we study the I/O signatures of the algorithm in detail. The results of this research affirm that a distributed-memory computing architecture such as BG/P is a scalable platform for large visualization problems.",

In this paper, we present an in situ data processing method for both generating probability distribution functions (PDFs) from field data and reorganizing particle data using a single spatial organization scheme. This coupling between PDFs and particles allows for the interactive post hoc exploration of both data types simultaneously. Scientists can explore trends in large-scale data through the PDFs and subsequently extract desired particle subsets for further analysis.

This approach is limited by the difficulties in working effectively in the transfer function space beyond two dimensions. We present a new approach to the volume classification problem which couples machine learning and a painting metaphor to allow more sophisticated classification in an intuitive manner. The user works in the volume data space by directly painting on sample slices of the volume and the painted voxels are used in an iterative training process. The trained system can then classify the entire volume. Both classification and rendering can be hardware accelerated, providing immediate visual feedback as painting progresses. Such an intelligent system approach enables the user to perform classification in a much higher dimensional space without explicitly specifying the mapping for every dimension used. Furthermore, the trained system for one data set may be reused to classify other data sets with similar characteristics.",

Most feature extraction and tracking methods first identify features of interest in each time step independently, then correspond these features in consecutive time steps of the data. Since these methods handle each time step separately, they do not use the coherency of the feature along the time dimension in the extraction process. In this paper, we present a prediction-correction method that uses a prediction step to make the best guess of the feature region in the subsequent time step, followed by growing and shrinking the border of the predicted region to coherently extract the actual feature of interest. This method makes use of the temporal-space coherency of the data to accelerate the extraction process while implicitly solving the tedious correspondence problem that previous methods focus on. Our method is low cost with very little storage overhead, and thus facilitates interactive or runtime extraction and visualization, unlike previous methods which were largely suited for batch-mode processing due to high computational cost.",

Numerous statistical tools and data transformations, such as projections, binning and clustering, have been coupled with visualization to help analysts understand data better and faster. However, data is inherently uncertain, due to error, noise or unreliable sources. When making decisions based on uncertain data, it is important to quantify and present to the analyst both the aggregated uncertainty of the results and the impact of the sources of that uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new framework to support uncertainty in the visual analytics process, through statistic methods such as uncertainty modeling, propagation and aggregation. We show that data transformations, such as regression, principal component analysis and k-means clustering, can be adapted to account for uncertainty. This framework leads to better visualizations that improve the decision-making process and help analysts gain insight on the analytic process itself.",

Although 2D scatterplots are ubiquitous due to their simplicity and familiarity, there are not a lot of variations on their basic metaphor. In this paper, we present a new way of visualizing multidimensional data using scatterplots. We extend 2D scatterplots using sensitivity coefficients to highlight local variation of one variable with respect to another. When applied to a scatterplot, these sensitivities can be understood as velocities, and the resulting visualization resembles a flow field.

            "abstract": "Scatterplots are commonly used to visualize multidimensional data; however, 2D projections of data offer limited understanding of the high-dimensional interactions between data points. We introduce an interactive 3D extension of scatterplots called the Regression Cube (RC), which augments a 3D scatterplot with three facets on which the correlations between the two variables are revealed by sensitivity lines and sensitivity streamlines. The sensitivity visualization of local regression on the 2D projections provides insights about the shape of the data through its orientation and continuity cues. We also introduce a series of visual operations such as clustering, brushing, and selection supported in RC. By iteratively refining the selection of data points of interest, RC is able to reveal salient local correlation patterns that may otherwise remain hidden with a global analysis. We have demonstrated our system with two examples and a user-oriented evaluation, and we show how RCs enable interactive visual exploration of multidimensional datasets via a variety of classification and information retrieval tasks. A video demo of RC is available.",

Creating animations is an essential task in presenting complex scientific visualizations. Existing visualization systems use an established animation function based on keyframes selected by the user. This approach is limited in providing the optimal in-between views of the data. Alternatively, computer graphics and virtual reality camera motion planning is frequently focused on collision free movement in a virtual walkthrough. For semi-transparent, fuzzy, or blobby volume data the collision free objective becomes insufficient. Here, we provide a set of essential criteria focused on computing camera paths to establish effective animations of volume data. Our dynamic multi-criteria solver coupled with a force-directed routing algorithm enables rapid generation of camera paths. Once users review the resulting animation and evaluate the camera motion, they are able to determine how each criterion impacts path generation. In this paper, we demonstrate how incorporating this animation approach with an interactive volume visualization system reduces the effort in creating context-aware and coherent animations. This frees the user to focus on visualization tasks with the objective of gaining additional insight from the volume data.",

One of the challenges in multimodal visualization is how to simplify the process of generating informative pictures from complementary data. In this paper we present an automatic technique that makes use of dual modality information, such as CT and PET, to produce effective focuscontext volume visualization. With volume ray casting, per-ray visibility histograms summarize the contribution of samples along each ray to the final image. By quantifying visibility for the region of interest, indicated by the PET data, occluding tissues can be made just transparent enough to give a clear view of the features in that region while preserving some context. Unlike most previous methods relying on costly-preprocessing and tedious manual tuning, our technique achieves comparable and better results based on on-the-fly processing that still enables interactive visualization. Our work thus offers a powerful visualization technique for examining multimodal volume data.

A cloud computing system is often comprised of a large number of parallel computing and storage devices. Monitoring the usage and performance of such a system is important for efficient operations, maintenance, and security. Tracing every application on a large cloud system is untenable due to scale and privacy issues. But profile data can be collected relatively efficiently by regularly sampling the state of the system, including properties such as CPU load, memory usage, network usage, and others, creating a set of multivariate time series for each system. Adequate tools for studying such large-scale, multidimensional data are lacking. In this paper, we present a visual based analysis approach to understanding and analyzing the performance and behavior of cloud computing systems. Our design is based on similarity measures and a layout method to portray the behavior of each compute node over time. When visualizing a large number of behavioral lines together, distinct patterns often appear suggesting particular types of performance bottleneck. The resulting system provides multiple linked views, which allow the user to interactively explore the data by examining the data or a selected subset at different levels of detail. Our case studies, which use datasets collected from two different cloud systems, show that this visual based approach is effective in identifying trends and anomalies of the systems.",

The effectiveness of such a visual validation and analysis process mainly relies on a good strategy to categorize and visualize the lines. However, the sheer size of line data produced by state-of-the-art scientific simulations poses great challenges to preparing the data for visualization. In this paper, we present a parallelization design of regression model-based clustering to categorize large line data derived from detailed scientific simulations by leveraging the power of heterogeneous computers. This parallel clustering method employs the Expectation Maximization algorithm to iteratively approximate the optimal data partitioning. First, we use a sorted-balance algorithm to partition and distribute the lines with various lengths among multiple compute nodes. During the following iterative clustering process, regression model parameters are recovered based on the local lines on each individual node, with only a few inter-node message exchanges involved. Meanwhile, the workload of regression model computing is well balanced across the nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively categorize large line data in a scalable manner to concisely convey dynamic structures and interactions, leading to a visualization that captures salient features and suppresses visual clutter to facilitate scientific exploration of large line data.",

We achieve this by automatically extracting layers depicted in composited images. The layers can then be recombined in different ways to simulate opacity changes and recoloring of individual features. Our results demonstrate that explorable images are especially useful when the volume data is too large for interactive exploration, takes too long to render due to the underlying mesh structure or desired shading effect, or if the original volume data is not available.

Interactivity may be hindered due to many factors, e.g. large data size,high resolution or complexity of a data set, or an expensive rendering algorithm. We present a novel framework for visualizing volumedata that enables interactive exploration using proxy images, without accessing the original 3D data. Data exploration using directvolume rendering requires multiple (often redundant) accesses to possibly large amounts of data. The notion of visualization by proxyrelies on the ability to defer operations traditionally used for exploring 3D data to a more suitable intermediate representation forinteraction - proxy images. Such operations include view changes, transfer function exploration, and relighting. While previous workhas addressed specific interaction needs, we provide a complete solution that enables real-time interaction with large data sets andhas low hardware and storage requirements.",

            "abstract": "Successful in-situ and remote visualization solutions must have minimal storage requirements and account for only a small percentage of supercomputing time. One solution that meets these requirements is to store a compact intermediate representation of the data, instead of a 3D volume itself. Recent work explores the use of attenuation functions as a data representation that summarizes the distribution of attenuation along the rays. This representation goes beyond conventional static images and allows users to dynamically explore their data, for example, to change color and opacity parameters, without accessing the original 3D data. The computation and storage costs of this method may still be prohibitively expensive for large and time-varying data sets, thus limiting its applicability in the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for computing attenuation functions in parallel. We exploit the fact that the distribution of attenuation can be constructed recursively from a hierarchy of blocks or intervals of the data, which is a highly parallelizeable process. We have developed a library of routines that can be used in a distance visualization scenario or can be called directly from a simulation code to generate explorable images in-situ. Through a number of examples, we demonstrate the application of this work to large-scale scientific simulations in a real-world parallel environment with thousands of processors. We also explore various compression methods for reducing the size of the RAF. Finally, we present a method for computing an alternative RAF representation, which more closely encodes the actual distribution of samples along a ray, using kernel density estimation.",

Each type of mesh paradigms has inherent advantages and disadvantages. Thus, the methods of coupling multiple mesh paradigms have been developed to facilitate the use of different solvers in different part of the computational domain. However, the complex hybrid gridding paradigm poses challenges to rendering calculations for visualizing the data. This paper describes a volume visualization system for time-varying adaptive moving-body CFD datasets, where the grid system consists of unstructured grids near the body surface, coupled with Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (SAMR) grid in the off-body domain. We present two approaches to the hybrid-grid volume ray casting: a KD-tree based single-pass algorithm, and a multi-pass algorithm using the depth peeling technique. The system has a three-level memory hierarchy: GPU memory, main memory, and a solid state drive (SSD). Through data caching and prefetching within the memory hierarchy, the latency of time-step swapping can be hidden. Experimental results show that our system allows interactive volume exploration on single-GPU commodity PCs.",

This paper presents a new approach to enhancing depth-ordering perception of volume rendered images without using additional visual cues. We set up an energy function based on quantitative perception models to measure the quality of the images in terms of the effectiveness of depth-ordering and transparency perception as well as the faithfulness of the information revealed.

Gradient estimation is necessary for rendering shaded isosurfaces and specular highlights, which provide important cues for shape and depth. Gradient estimation has been widely studied and deployed for regular-grid volume data to achieve local illumination effects, but has been, otherwise, for unstructured-mesh data. As a result, most of the unstructured-mesh volume visualizations made so far were unlit. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of gradient estimation methods for unstructured meshes with respect to their cost and performance. Through a number of benchmarks, we discuss the effects of mesh quality and scalar function complexity in the accuracy of the reconstruction, and their impact in lighting-enabled volume rendering. Based on our study, we also propose two heuristic improvements to the gradient reconstruction process. The first heuristic improves the rendering quality with a hybrid algorithm that combines the results of the multiple reconstruction methods, based on the properties of a given mesh. The second heuristic improves the efficiency of its GPU implementation, by restricting the computation of the gradient on a fixed-size local neighborhood.",

The basis of the design is a partial differential equation based illumination model to simulate the light propagation, absorption, and scattering within the volumetric medium. In particular, a two-level scheme is introduced to overcome the challenges presented by unstructured grids. Test results show that the added illumination effects such as global shadowing and multiple scattering not only lead to more visually pleasing visualization, but also greatly enhance the perception of the depth information and complex spatial relationships for features of interest in the volume data.

This paper presents a study on the design of online guides that educate new users on how to utilize information visualizations, particularly focusing on the employment of exercise questions in the guides. We use two concepts from educational psychology, learning type (or learning style) and teaching method, to design four unique types of online guides. The effects of the guides are measured by comprehension tests of a large group of crowdsourced participants. The tests covered four visualization types (graph, scatter plot, storyline, and tree map) and a complete range of visual analytics tasks. Our statistical analyses indicate that online guides which employ active learning and the top-down teaching method are the most effective. Our study provides quantitative insight into the use of exercise questions in online guides for information visualizations and will inspire further research on design considerations for other elements in introductory materials.",

We present Temporal Summary Images (TSIs) as an approach for both exploring this data and creating stories from it. As a visualization, a TSI is composed of three common components: (1) a temporal layout, (2) comic strip-style data snapshots, and (3) textual annotations. To augment user analysis and exploration, we have developed a number of interactive techniques that recommend relevant data features and design choices, including an automatic annotations workflow. As the analysis and visual design processes converge, the resultant image becomes appropriate for data storytelling. For validation, we use a prototype implementation for TSIs to conduct two case studies with large-scale, scientific simulation datasets.",

            "abstract": "Interactive visualizations can allow science museum visitors to explore new worlds by seeing and interacting with scientific data. However, designing interactive visualizations for informal learning environments, such as museums, presents several challenges. First, visualizations must engage visitors on a personal level. Second, visitors often lack the background to interpret visualizations of scientific data. Third, visitors have very limited time at individual exhibits in museums. This paper examines these design considerations through the iterative development and evaluation of an interactive exhibit as a visualization tool that gives museumgoers access to scientific data generated and used by researchers. The exhibit prototype, Living Liquid, encourages visitors to ask and answer their own questions while exploring the time-varying global distribution of simulated marine microbes using a touchscreen interface. Iterative development proceeded through three rounds of formative evaluations using think-aloud protocols and interviews, each round informing a key visualization design decision: (1) what to visualize to initiate inquiry, (2) how to link data at the microscopic scale to global patterns, and (3) how to include additional data that allows visitors to pursue their own questions. Data from visitor evaluations suggests that, when designing visualizations for public audiences, one should (1) avoid distracting visitors from data that they should explore, (2) incorporate background information into the visualization, (3) favor understandability over scientific accuracy, and (4) layer data accessibility to structure inquiry. Lessons learned from this case study add to our growing understanding of how to use visualizations to actively engage learners with scientific data.",

            "abstract": "Design methodologies for information visualizations are typically based on the assumption that the users will be fully engaged in the visual exploration of the displayed information. However, recent research suggests that there is an increasing diversity in how users engage with modern visualizations, and that the traditional design theories do not always satisfy the varied users needs. In this paper, we present a new design concept, engagement-versatile design, for visualizations that target users with a variety of engagement styles. Without losing generality, we demonstrate the feasibility of this concept through the designing of a system called Stock Lamp, an engagement-versatile visualization that helps users keep track of the stock market in real-time. This design process includes identifying different modes of engagement, deriving design implications from each engagement-mode, and applying them to the visualization's design. Our user study shows that Stock Lamp is able to consistently relay market information even when the users are multi-tasking. We believe this study establishes a new concept that promotes a systematic design approach that leverages both theoretical and empirical design methodologies for future visualization development.",

As the volume and the variety of features used to describe a phenomenon keeps increasing, DR has become not only desirable but paramount. However, DR can result in unreliable depictions of data. The uncertainties involved in DR may stem from the selection of methods, parameter configurations, and the constraints imposed by the user. To address these uncertainties, various means of DR quality assessment have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, how to optimize the trade-off between the quantification efficiency and accuracy is yet to be further studied. The purpose of this paper is to present a general technique, in the context of visual analytics, to support efficient uncertainty-aware high-dimensional data exploration. We model the uncertainty based on how well neighborhood geometries are preserved during DR. We employ approximated nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms to speed up the quantification process with marginal decrease in accuracy. We then visualize the quantified uncertainties in the form of augmented scatter plot. We test our technique with three real world datasets against several well-known DR techniques, and discuss possible underlying causes that lead to certain embedding patterns. Our results show that our approach is effective and beneficial for both DR assessment and user-centered data exploration.",

However, visualization tools that rapidly quantify simulation uncertainty may require precise tuning, give limited information, or struggle to disentangle uncertainty sources. We propose a fast, scalable regression-based approach that uses bootstrapping on small samples of simulation data to model the effect of uncertainty from discreteness. We test the approach on three types of simulations with unique sources of uncertainty: particles (dark matter), ensembles (ocean), and discretized flows (traffic). We create a visualization tool to facilitate this modeling, showing training data and predictions in real time. Scientists, who need to provide only modest supervision, can use our tool to quickly understand how initial conditions and parameterizations affect observable quantities, their uncertainties, and their agreement with experimental data. We show that our tool offers a speedup of several orders of magnitude over comparable uncertainty calculation approaches.",

Our method models light propagation, including both absorption and scattering, in a volume using a convection-diffusion equation that can be solved numerically. The main advantage of such technique is that the light modeling and simulation can be separated, where we can use a unified partial-differential equation to model various illumination effects, and adopt highly-parallelized grid-based numerical schemes to solve it.

This paper presents an incremental DR solution. We enhance an existing incremental PCA method in several ways to ensure its usability for visualizing streaming multidimensional data. First, we use geometric transformation and animation methods to help preserve a viewer's mental map when visualizing the incremental results.

With additional ontology information, the semantics behind the network structure can be further explored. Unfortunately, creating network visualizations with these datasets for presentation can inadvertently expose the private and sensitive information of individuals that reside in the data. To deal with this problem, we generalize conventional data anonymization models (originally designed for relational data) and formally apply them in the context of privacy preserving ontological network visualization. We use these models to identify the privacy leaks that exist in a visualization, provide graph modification actions that remove and/or perceptually minimize the effect of the identified leaks, and discuss strategies for what types of privacy actions to choose depending on the context of the leaks. We implement an ontological visualization interface with associated privacy preserving operations, and demonstrate with two case studies using real-world datasets to show that our approach can identify and solve potential privacy issues while balancing overall graph readability and utility.",

By linking the distance plot with phase plots, one can more easily investigate the spatiotemporal patterns, and by extending the plot to visualize particle weights in conjunction with the phase space trajectories, the visualization better supports the needs of domain experts studying particle-in-cell simulations.

Unfortunately, such visualizations can inadvertently expose the ostensibly private identities of the persons that make up the dataset. By purposely violating graph readability metrics for a small region of the graph, we conjecture that local, exposed privacy leaks may be perceptually masked from easy recognition. In particular, we consider three commonly known metricsxe2x80x94edge crossing, node clustering, and node-edge overlappingxe2x80x94as a strategy to hide leaks. We evaluate the effectiveness of violating these metrics by conducting a user study that measures subject performance at visually searching for and identifying a privacy leak. Results show that when more masking operations are applied, participants needed more time to locate the privacy leak, though exhaustive, brute force search can eventually find it. We suggest future directions on how perceptual masking can be a viable strategy, primarily where modifying the underlying network structure is unfeasible.",

P4's programming interface offers a declarative visualization grammar for rapid specifications of data transformations, visual encodings, and interactions. By simplifying the development of GPU-accelerated visualization systems while supporting a high degree of flexibility and customization for design specification, P4 narrows the gap between expressiveness and scalability in information visualization toolkits.

Selecting a xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users.",

In practice, users often visualize a graph in multiple layouts by using different methods and varying parameter settings until they find a layout that best suits the purpose of the visualization. However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined heuristics.",

However, to interpret the DR result for gaining useful insights from the data, it would take additional analysis effort such as identifying clusters and understanding their characteristics. While there are many automatic methods (e.g., density-based clustering methods) to identify clusters, effective methods for understanding a cluster's characteristics are still lacking. A cluster can be mostly characterized by its distribution of feature values. Reviewing the original feature values is not a straightforward task when the number of features is large. To address this challenge, we present a visual analytics method that effectively highlights the essential features of a cluster in a DR result. To extract the essential features, we introduce an enhanced usage of contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA). Our method, called ccPCA (contrasting clusters in PCA), can calculate each feature's relative contribution to the contrast between one cluster and other clusters. With ccPCA, we have created an interactive system including a scalable visualization of clusters' feature contributions.
